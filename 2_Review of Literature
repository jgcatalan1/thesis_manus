REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Overview of Rice Production in the Philippines
The Philippines remains one of the world's leading rice producers, ranking as the 8th largest globally, behind major rice-producing nations such as China, Indonesia, and India (DA Press Office, 2022). Rice farming in the country has a rich history spanning thousands of years and continues to serve as a cornerstone of Philippine agriculture. Since 2016, approximately five million hectares of land have been dedicated to rice cultivation, yielding about 20 million metric tons of unmilled rice in 2022 (Balita, 2024b). For 2023, the Department of Agriculture’s National Rice Program projects local palay production to reach 19.50 million metric tons, translating to 12.754 million metric tons of milled rice, despite the persistent challenges of rising costs for fuel, fertilizer, and other inputs (DA-AFID, 2022).
In terms of regional contributions, Luzon accounted for 45.5 percent of the country’s total agricultural and fisheries production at constant 2018 prices in 2023, as shown in Fig. 1. Mindanao followed with a substantial 36.7 percent share, driven by its fertile lands, favorable climate, and strategic position as a major agricultural hub (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2024). Known as the "food basket" of the Philippines, Mindanao plays a crucial role in the country’s rice production and serves as a key supplier of high-value crops such as rice, bananas, coconuts, and pineapples (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2020). The region's agricultural productivity continues to benefit from diverse cropping systems, farmer ingenuity, and the integration of advanced farming technologies, solidifying its role as a pillar of national food security and economic stability.

In the Davao Region, agricultural productivity is exemplified by the average rice yields per hectare across its provinces. According to data presented in Fig. 2, Davao del Sur leads the region with the highest average yield at 4.84 metric tons per hectare, followed by Davao Oriental at 4.59 metric tons per hectare, Davao de Oro at 4.42 metric tons per hectare, and Davao del Norte at 4.39 metric tons per hectare. Davao Occidental, in contrast, lags significantly with an average yield of only 2.91 metric tons per hectare. These figures highlight significant disparities in agricultural efficiency and capacity within the region (Philippine Rice Research Institute, n.d.).
Davao del Sur, particularly the municipality of Hagonoy, is recognized as one of the leading rice-producing areas in Region XI. Hagonoy’s agricultural performance exceeds the provincial and regional averages, with average yields surpassing six metric tons per hectare compared to the provincial average of just over five metric tons and the regional average of around four metric tons. The municipality’s 1,436 farmers manage approximately 2,046 hectares of irrigated rice fields, contributing significantly to local rice production (Hondrade, 2007).

Moreover, the municipality's fertile soil, which are adaptable to a variety of crops, further bolster its agricultural capacity. According to Hondrade (2007), about 10,000 hectares in Hagonoy are suitable for coconut, corn, sugarcane, and irrigated lowland rice. Fig. 3 provides a comparative perspective on rice productivity across the municipalities of Davao del Sur in 2023. Among the municipalities, Matan-ao recorded the highest average rice yield of 5.05 metric tons per hectare, followed by Kiblawan with 5.00 metric tons per hectare. These municipalities demonstrate superior rice productivity, likely due to optimized agronomic practices, advanced irrigation systems, and favorable agroecological conditions. Conversely, Sulop and Malalag are at the lower end of the spectrum, with yields of 4.62 and 4.55 metric tons per hectare, respectively. Hagonoy, with an average yield of 4.97 metric tons per hectare, stands as one of the better-performing municipalities in the province.

The yield performance of Hagonoy suggests the presence of effective agricultural practices, reliable irrigation infrastructure, and moderate resilience to challenges such as pests, diseases, and adverse weather conditions. However, its slight yield gap compared to the leading municipalities such as Matan-ao and Kiblawan indicates areas for improvement. These differences could be attributed to variations in irrigation efficiency, fertilizer application timing and methods, selection of rice varieties, and pest and disease management practices. By addressing these gaps, Hagonoy has the potential to enhance its agricultural performance further.
To strengthen rice production and resilience in Hagonoy, research institutions across the Philippines have been actively developing new rice varieties and refining cultivation techniques. These advancements aim to improve crop maturation processes and mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture. The integration of modern farming practices, alongside the utilization of diversified rice varieties, has been instrumental in boosting rice yields nationally (Balita, 2024b; DA Press Office, 2022). These innovations, when tailored to the specific needs of Hagonoy and supported by localized training programs, could drive further improvements in rice productivity.
Hagonoy exemplifies significant potential as a high-performing rice-producing municipality in Davao del Sur. With targeted interventions and continued adoption of science-based agricultural practices, it can further solidify its contribution to regional and national food security. Achieving this, however, requires a clear understanding of the biological and agronomic foundations that govern rice yield.
Plant Morphology and Varietal Influences on Rice Yield
A deeper appreciation of the rice plant’s biology and the agronomic factors influencing yield is essential for optimizing productivity in high-performing areas such as Hagonoy. Rice yield is fundamentally shaped by the plant’s morphological characteristics, the classification of varieties, and the processes of grain development. Insights into these aspects provide the scientific basis for identifying yield determinants and designing effective, targeted interventions that respond to the needs of local farmers.
The rice plant
Rice, belonging to the family Gramineae and the genus Oryza, is a staple crop with significant global importance. Of the approximately 20 species within the genus, only Oryza sativa L. ("Asian rice") and Oryza glaberrima Steud. ("African rice") are commonly cultivated, with Oryza sativa being the predominant species worldwide (RiceHub, n.d.). Within Oryza sativa, three main subspecies are recognized: indica, javanica, and japonica, each adapted to different geographic and climatic conditions (Heinrichs, n.d.).
Indica varieties thrive in tropical and subtropical regions, making them a staple in South and Southeast Asia and southern China. Javanica varieties, including bulu (awned) and gundil (awnless) types, are notable for long panicles and bold grains, and are primarily grown in Indonesia. Japonica varieties, with their short, round grains, are suited to temperate climates and widely cultivated in Japan, China, and Korea. The adaptability of these varieties to specific conditions influences their distribution and productivity; for example, japonica rice is grown in northern California for its tolerance to lower night temperatures, whereas indica dominates southern U.S. regions (Heinrichs, n.d.).
Palay. In the Filipino context, palay refers to rice at any stage prior to husking (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). It is an annual warm-season grass that typically reaches heights of 1 to 1.8 meters, depending on variety and soil fertility. Its long, slender leaves, which are up to 100 centimeters in length are rough-textured with fine notches and prickles. The plant’s fibrous root system, consisting of seminal and nodal roots with lateral branches, is essential for water and nutrient absorption, paralleling other cereal crops.
 
Fig. 4. The anatomy of Rice plant lifted from bioRender.com by Eunice Huang (n.d.).
The reproductive structure of the rice plant is the panicle, a branched inflorescence that can grow up to 30 centimeters long. As grains mature, the panicle droops, bearing 80 to 120 grains on average, though this number varies with variety, environment, and crop management. Each grain is enclosed within a protective husk (rice hull), forming the pericarp of the ripened ovary and typically exhibiting an oblong or ovoid shape. The edible portion, or bigas in Filipino, is about 12 millimeters long and 3 millimeters thick. Grain and husk color changes as the grain ripens, with varieties displaying white, brown, or black grains (Chang and Bardenas, 1965; Matic Hub, 2021; RiceHub, n.d.).
Understanding the anatomy of the rice plant is crucial for yield optimization. The roots secure the plant and facilitate nutrient uptake; stems transport water and nutrients; leaves drive photosynthesis; and tillers produce shoots that form additional panicles. Each panicle’s grain yield is determined by genetic, environmental, and management factors. A closer look in Fig. 4 at the rice grain reveals its by-products: the protective husk, nutrient-rich bran, starchy white rice, and the germ, all of which play roles in agricultural productivity and food value (International Rice Research Institute, n.d.). 
Beyond these biological foundations, the ways in which farmers cultivate and manage rice have a deep impact on overall productivity.
Rice Farming Practices in the Philippines
The evolution of rice farming practices in the Philippines highlights a continuous effort to improve productivity, sustainability, and adaptability to changing agricultural needs. Historical developments in rice production are closely tied to the introduction of new rice varieties, which can be categorized into three major eras: Pre-Green Revolution, Green Revolution, and Post-Green Revolution. During the pre-Green Revolution, traditional rice varieties dominated, with farmers typically planting only once a year. The Green Revolution (1966–1988) introduced high-yielding varieties that supported two growing seasons annually, significantly boosting productivity. The post-Green Revolution period (1989 to present) focuses on enhancing both yield and sustainability through advanced practices and technologies (Bautista and Javier, 2005; Vicente et al., 2023). The Bureau of Agriculture and Fisheries Standards (BAFS) (2019) developed the Philippine National Standard (PNS) Code of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for Rice for setting consolidated safety and quality standards covering the production, harvesting and on farm post-harvest handling and storage of rice.
Good agricultural practices (GAP)
According to the Agricultural Training Institute (2022), Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) refer to farm-level approaches designed to minimize the risk of contamination throughout both on-farm production and postproduction processes. GAP recommendations emphasize environmental protection, food safety, worker health and welfare, and product quality. These practices are guided by principles, regulations, and technical recommendations that apply to primary production, processing, and food transport. The guidelines established and agreed upon by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which the Philippines as one of its ten member countries, serve as a bridge between traditional farming methods and the modern market, aligning agricultural production with the standards and expectations of various stakeholders, including consumers.
For rice production, GAP highlights several key areas for inspection: the farm’s location and environment, structural and facility maintenance, farming practices, worker health and safety, and overall management. Effective implementation of GAP requires proper farm management, which includes constructing suitable farm structures such as waste disposal facilities and dedicated storage areas for harvested produce and equipment, as well as clearly marked and labeled field plots. Sustainable practices, such as efficient soil and water management, responsible use of pesticides and fertilizers, and integrated pest and disease control, are essential for compliance. Furthermore, harvesting, packaging, and storage must meet strict quality standards. Consideration of a farm’s history including prior land use and neighboring activities, along with comprehensive record-keeping of inputs, practices, produce, sales, and training, ensures that farms meet GAP requirements and secure certification (Agricultural Training Institute, 2022; Palizada, 2016).
Building on these GAP principles, specific recommendations for enhancing Philippine rice productivity have been identified through research initiatives. PhilRice-IRRI study recommends the use of hybrid varieties, optimal use of fertilizers, training of more farmers on rice technologies, and educating future farmers as some of the ways to boost rice productivity in the country (Pasiona, 2015). Bordey et al. (2015) further highlights that competitiveness rests on the ability of a farmer to produce palay at the same or superior quality and at a lower cost than local or international competitors. They emphasize the promotion of hybrid rice technology coupled with appropriate crop management, intensified use of labor-saving technologies such as combines harvesters and direct seeding, continued irrigation programs, and improved milling efficiency. The study further stresses the need to invest in state-of-the-art rice research and development (R&D) initiatives to create next-generation technologies for future yield growth.

 
Fig. 5. Status of PhilGAP Implementation as of 2016 lifted from Palizada (2016). Region II recorded the highest number of certified farmers, followed by Region III, with Regions I and XI tied as the third highest in terms of certifications.
Despite government efforts through the Department of Agriculture to strengthen and intensify the PhilGAP program, implementation across Philippine regions remains uneven. Fig. 5 illustrates these disparities: Region II leads with 49 certified farms, followed by Region III with 12, while Region XI lags with only 4 certified farms (Palizada, 2016). 
This uneven adoption highlights substantial challenges in achieving widespread certification and reflects underlying barriers to effective implementation of GAP in certain areas. Addressing these challenges, through increased awareness, robust support systems, and infrastructure investments, this can improve certification rates. Furthermore, these requires increased awareness and support among farmers. Given its agricultural potential, Region XI could enhance its performance and contribute more substantially to food safety, produce quality, and market competitiveness. 
Digital rice production knowledge platforms
The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) developed the Rice Knowledge Bank (RKB). It is a digital extension service offering practical solutions tailored to small-scale farmers. The RKB integrates cutting-edge agricultural techniques, best practices, and research findings to help farmers optimize their processes. Building on this foundation, the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) created the localized Pinoy Rice Knowledge Bank (PRKB), which adapts the RKB framework to the specific needs of Filipino farmers. The PRKB provides country-specific, up-to-date information on rice and rice-based cropping systems, ensuring relevance to the local context (International Rice Research Institute, n.d.).
In Fig. 6, the RKB outlines the three essential stages of rice production: pre-planting, growth, and post-harvest. Pre-planting activities include selecting the right variety, preparing cropping calendars, and field preparation, which are foundational for a successful rice crop. During the growth stage, farmers focus on managing water, fertilizers, pests, and weeds to ensure healthy crop development. Finally, post-harvest processes such as drying, storage, and milling are critical for maintaining the quality and marketability of the rice harvest  (“Step-by-step production - IRRI Rice Knowledge Bank,” n.d.).

Complementing the global perspective provided by the RKB, the PRKB, as shown in Fig. 7, serves as a rich repository of localized information designed specifically for Filipino farmers. It offers extensive resources on rice farming in the Philippines, including downloadable materials such as videos and PowerPoint presentations. These materials focus on yield-enhancing and cost-reducing technologies, empowering farmers to optimize their practices in alignment with the unique challenges and opportunities in the Philippine agricultural landscape (Philippine Rice Research Institute, n.d.).
Local rice production practices. Rice farming in Barangay Balutakay, Hagonoy, Davao del Sur (2014) reflects these broader developments in a community-specific context. According to their Barangay Development Plan, rice is grown biannually in two primary seasons: the “panuig” (wet season) and the “pangulilang” (dry season). 
Illustrated in Fig. 8, the dry season begins with land preparation in December (in color blue), followed by planting in January (green color), maintenance through March and April (yellow color), and harvesting in April (orange color). 

 
Fig. 8. Cropping Pattern of Rice and Corn in Barangay Balukatay, Hagonoy lifted from the Barangay Balutakay, Hagonoy, Davao del Sur (2014).
During the wet season, land preparation starts in June, with planting completed by July, maintenance carried out through August and September, and harvesting in October. In the transition months of May and November, farmers commonly plant alternative crops such as watermelon or mung beans. Crop yield is closely linked to the timely availability and application of inputs, which can be impacted by rising costs. 
The evolution of rice farming practices in the Philippines, from traditional methods to the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and digital extension platforms like the Rice Knowledge Bank, shows an ongoing commitment to increasing productivity, ensuring sustainability, and addressing the diverse challenges faced by local farmers. However, as shown by regional disparities in GAP certification and the influence of local cropping patterns, the effectiveness of these initiatives relies on the timely and efficient management of fundamental production inputs. These practices are closely connected to the key factors that determine rice yield, such as the selection and use of high-quality seeds, proper fertilizer and pesticide management, efficient land preparation, and adaptation to environmental and economic conditions. The next section examines these critical factors, drawing on both local and international research to better understand their roles in shaping rice yield outcomes in the Philippines.
Key Factors of Rice Production
The success of rice production is heavily influenced by the quantity and quality of key inputs in farming. Influenced by a complex interplay of agronomic, environmental, economic, and technological factors, these inputs can play critical roles in determining yield essential for improving rice farming outcomes in the Philippines, as highlighted in several studies. 
Ginting and Andari (2021) conducted research in Tanah Miring District, Merauke Regency, Indonesia, showing that seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and labor collectively have a significant impact on rice production, as indicated by an F-test value of 0.000. However, when analyzed individually, only seeds and pesticides had a statistically significant effect, while fertilizers and labor showed no significant influence. This suggests that optimizing seed quality and pesticide use is crucial for improving yields, whereas the effects of fertilizers and labor may depend on factors like soil conditions and farming practices.
Koirala et al. (2013) examined the technical efficiency of rice farmers in the Philippines using a stochastic frontier production model. Their findings emphasized that fertilizer costs and land area were significant determinants of production. A 1% increase in land area resulted in a 0.48% increase in output, highlighting the critical role of expanding the acreage in enhancing productivity. Other factors such as fuel costs, planting season, and land rent also significantly affected production and efficiency. In contrast, herbicide use had no direct effect on productivity, as it primarily functions to prevent damage rather than boost yield.
Dait (2023) analyzed the effects of climate and economic variables on rice production across six major rice-producing regions in the Philippines. The study found that land area and urea application significantly increased rice production in irrigated areas, while rainfall and temperature negatively impacted yields. In rainfed areas, both land area and fertilizer use were positively associated with production, although adverse effects of rainfall were noted. The findings underscored the importance of long-term strategies to expand land use, improve irrigation systems, and adopt climate-resilient farming practices to sustain production levels.
David (2023) highlighted the indirect but significant effects of environmental factors such as rainfall, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure on rice yields in the Pampanga River Basin. These variables influence the growth and development of rice crops, emphasizing the need to consider environmental conditions when managing agronomic inputs.
Ashari et al. (2024) pointed out that yield losses occur across multiple stages of the supply chain, including harvesting, drying, storage, and milling. Factors like crop variety, harvest timing, and the use of agricultural tools significantly influence yield losses. The study recommended adopting modern agricultural technologies and good agricultural practices (GAP) to minimize these losses.
The table above presents a summary of key inputs identified in the literature, along with their corresponding references. As shown in Table 1, these have been recognized across multiple studies as critical determinants of rice yield. Optimizing the management of key inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and land area is essential for achieving higher rice yields in the Philippines.

The selection of high-quality seeds and the use of effective pest control methods can directly increase crop productivity, as highlighted in studies on technology adoption and crop management practices (Mariano et al., 2012; Matala et al., 2011). Fertilizer use and land allocation require careful consideration of local agronomic and economic factors to maximize benefits (Matala et al., 2011). Additionally, minimizing inefficiencies in the supply chain and adopting climate-resilient farming practices can enhance both productivity and sustainability (Dait, 2023; Stuecker et al., 2018). 
While environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature are included due to their significant impact on rice yield, this review emphasizes factor that farmers can directly manage and optimize. This focus can allow for the development of practical recommendations that can be adopted at the farm level to improve productivity. By focusing on these actionable factors, practical recommendations can be developed to empower farmers in improving productivity at the ground level. Considering rapid advancements in agricultural practices, farmers now have access to emerging tools and strategies that further support their decision-making and input management.
Digital Technologies and Tools in Rice Farming
The integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into rice farming represents a transformative shift toward more precise and data-driven agricultural practices. Digital innovations such as mobile applications and smart farming solutions are not only modernizing traditional methods but also equipping farmers with real-time information, advanced analytics, and practical tools to address longstanding challenges and realize their yield potential. As highlighted by Tallada (2019), ICT holds immense promise for revolutionizing local rice production by boosting efficiency, lowering costs, and increasing yields through the adoption of precision agriculture techniques.
Building on these developments, Gabrillo and Torres (2022) investigated the practical impact of rice-specific ICT tools on both farmers and agricultural extension workers (AEWs). Their findings indicate that the adoption of ICT platforms enables farmers to better manage nutrients, forge stronger connections with buyers, and achieve higher productivity. For AEWs, these technologies streamline advisory tasks, enhance the delivery of services, and foster greater professional empowerment. Nonetheless, the widespread adoption of ICT in agriculture is still hindered by challenges such as high mobile data costs and unreliable network signals, which remain significant barriers, particularly in rural areas.

Existing mobile applications in rice farming
Angchay et al. (2024) conducted a qualitative study involving fourteen rice farmers in Davao del Sur. The aim was to thoroughly examine and document their experiences with using various agricultural applications on their smartphones for rice cultivation. They explored how digital interventions are shaping the practices and livelihoods of smallholder rice farmers in the region. The findings of the study highlight the transformative potential of these agri-apps, revealing that most participants experienced notable increases in both income and farming efficiency after integrating mobile technology into their agricultural routines. This positive impact was particularly distinct among those farmers who had participated in formal training sessions on the use of mobile applications, suggesting that digital literacy and capacity-building are essential components for successful technological adoption in agriculture.
Binhing Palay app. The Binhing Palay app, as shown in Fig. 9, provides agronomic and grain quality characteristics of over 200 rice varieties in the Philippines (Tallada, 2019). Developed by the Philippine Rice Research Institute (2021), this app serves as a guide for selecting rice varieties to plant before the season begins. It offers detailed information about yield, maturity, height, pest resistance, and other essential traits for each rice variety. Its search functionality and offline accessibility make it a reliable tool for decision-making (Softonic, n.d.).
eDamuhan app. The eDamuhan app, shown in Fig. 10, employs artificial intelligence for weed identification and control management. Farmers take photos of weeds using their phone’s camera, which are then analyzed by a central server using TensorFlow technology to identify the species. The app provides detailed information on the identified weed and its proper management techniques (Tallada, 2019). Angchay et al. (2024) noted that farmers described this app as a practical tool for managing weeds effectively, addressing a critical aspect of rice farming.

Minus-One Element Technique (MOET) app. Illustrated in Fig. 11, the MOET app assists farmers in assessing soil nutrient deficiencies through a pot-based fertilizer trial. Using composite soil samples, the app calculates fertilizer recommendations and yield estimates based on the biomass yield of potted rice plants. This removes much of the guesswork in fertility management, allowing farmers to make informed decisions about nutrient application (Tallada, 2019). Younger farmers, enthusiastic about integrating smartphone technologies into farming, have shown significant interest in this app.
PhilRice Leaf Color Computing Application. Based on a four-striped handheld tool known as the Leaf Color Chart (LCC), the PhilRice Leaf Color Computing Application (PhilRice LCC App) is designed to evaluate the nitrogen status of rice plants. (Philippine Rice Research Institute, 2021b). Shown in Fig. 12, it is an innovative tool designed to enhance precision agriculture by providing real-time fertilizer recommendations for rice farming. Using a smartphone's front camera, the app enables farmers to capture images of rice leaves, which are analyzed to assess nitrogen levels and determine precise fertilizer needs. The app provides recommendations for fertilizer application at critical growth stages, including the basal and panicle initiation stages, optimizing nutrient management and improving crop yield.
Additionally, the LCC App features a simple record-keeping system that allows farmers to document their fertilizer applications systematically. It also includes a farm profile feature to help track farm status, enabling informed and efficient farm management. Notably, the app supports all rice varieties registered under the National Seed Quality Control Services (NSQCS) as well as privately produced varieties, ensuring broad applicability across different farming contexts. These functionalities make the LCC App a valuable resource for promoting sustainable and efficient rice farming practices.
Table 2 summarizes the main features of each app as reported in the literature. Each application addresses needs. For example, eDamuhan specializes in weed identification, PhilRice LCC focuses on LCC-based nutrient management, and MOET app provides region-specific nutrient recommendations.

However, gaps remain, such as limited integration of variety selection, pest management, and local language support across the board. GabayPalay app is projected to address several of these gaps, while still having room for future enhancement in features like LCC and weed management.
In addition to these applications, farmers also use Accuweather app, SpidTech app, and Rice Doctor app (Angchay et al., 2024), all of which are readily available for download on the Google Play Store and are actively promoted on social media platforms. While the effectiveness of these applications remains under evaluation, they have sparked interest among farmers, particularly the younger generation, who are more inclined to adopt digital tools in their agricultural practices (Tallada, 2019).
Motivation for and impact of adopting rice farming applications
The growing interest and willingness to explore of these digital applications can be attributed in large part to government-led training programs, particularly the Digital Farmers Program 103 for Rice (DFP 103 for Rice) conducted by the Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Training Institute. Angchay et al. (2024) found that most rice farmers in Davao del Sur only began using mobile agricultural tools after attending such training, which emphasized hands-on practice and guidance in utilizing smartphone technology for agriculture. Only a few had prior exposure to these technologies, while the majority credited their newfound confidence and skills to formal capacity-building initiatives.
With this increased digital literacy and institutional support, farmers were able to incorporate smartphone-based farming applications more effectively into their daily routines. The impact of these digital platforms on rice production has been substantial. Farmers reported that the integration of digital tools into their routines led to greater efficiency and productivity (Angchay et al., 2024). Previously, they relied on traditional and often imprecise methods for weather forecasting, pest management, and crop selection, such as observing the sky or interpreting animal behavior. With the introduction of resources like Accuweather, Binhing Palay, and other mobile services, farmers can now make data-driven decisions, enabling more precise timing of agricultural operations, better selection of rice varieties, and optimized use of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides (Angchay et al., 2024; Tallada, 2019).
Many participants noted that agri-apps not only simplified their work but also contributed to increased income. Digital recommendations for input management and weather forecasts helped reduce wasted resources and improved yields. Furthermore, the ability to access accurate information independently reduced their reliance on agricultural extension workers for routine problems, allowing for quicker and more autonomous decision-making (Angchay et al., 2024). Overall, the experience of Davao del Sur rice farmers demonstrates that with proper support and training, digital agriculture tools can bring about meaningful improvements in both farm efficiency and livelihoods.
Challenges in utilizing mobile technologies for rice production
While the benefits of digital tools in rice production are evident, several challenges continue to hinder their widespread and effective adoption. Limited digital literacy remains a major barrier, especially among older farmers and those with little formal education. Many first-time users have trouble navigating smartphone interfaces and understanding how to properly utilize various features of agricultural applications. This lack of familiarity often leads to hesitation or lack of confidence in using new technologies for farm management (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
Another persistent obstacle is the issue of connectivity. In many rural areas, slow or unreliable internet access restricts farmers’ ability to fully utilize mobile applications that require regular updates or real-time data retrieval. This technical limitation not only affects the experience of using these platforms but also discourages sustained engagement, especially when farmers encounter repeated disruptions or delays (Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
Additionally, some farmers expressed concerns regarding the accuracy and relevance of information provided by certain applications. Occasional mismatches between local conditions and app recommendations can lead to frustration and uncertainty. There is also a perceived gap in personalized technical support, with some users finding it challenging to access timely assistance when encountering problems or needing clarification.
Despite these barriers, the resilience and adaptability of rice farmers remain evident. Many continue to seek out opportunities for further training and peer learning, recognizing the long-term advantages of digital technologies in agriculture. Ongoing efforts to improve digital infrastructure and expand farmer education are essential to overcome these challenges and enable more inclusive and effective adoption of mobile technologies in rice production (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
Yield Prediction Models in Rice Production Systems
Despite the promising adoption of mobile applications among rice farmers in Davao del Sur, challenges regarding the accuracy and relevance of information provided by certain applications continue to persist. Angchay et al. (2024) noted that some farmers expressed concerns about occasional mismatches between local conditions and app recommendations, which can lead to frustration and uncertainty in decision-making. Additionally, Gabrillo and Torres (2022) identified that while ICT platforms enable farmers to better manage nutrients and achieve higher productivity, widespread adoption is still hindered by technical limitations and reliability issues. To address these accuracy concerns and provide more precise agricultural recommendations that account for the complex interactions between multiple agronomic factors, mathematical modeling approaches have gained prominence in agricultural research.
Mathematical modeling has emerged as a critical tool in modern agriculture for predicting crop yields and optimizing farming decisions. Jagathesan (2020) highlights that the application of mathematical models in agriculture incorporates analytical, simulation, and empirical methods through five key stages: formulation, solution, interpretation, and validation. These models combine equations, charts, and formulas based on theory and literature to provide precision and strategic solutions to agricultural problems.
Several machine learning approaches have been employed for crop yield prediction, each with distinct characteristics and limitations. The selection of an appropriate model depends on factors such as data complexity, interpretability requirements, and prediction accuracy needs. The studies of David (2023) and Jiya et al. (2023) provide comprehensive evaluations of various predictive models for rice yield estimation.
Linear Regression model 
Linear Regression (LiR) models describe the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable, while independent variables are known as predictors, covariates (if continuous), or factors (if categorical). The matrix X, which contains predictor observations, is typically called the design matrix. (The MathWorks Inc., n.d.). 
The study of David (2023) modeled the relationship between rice crop yield (RCY) and explanatory variables using a linear equation. The response variable is rice yield (in kilograms per hectare), while the explanatory variables include factors such as material inputs. The mathematical representation of the linear regression model is expressed in equation [1]:
Y=α+β_1 "X" _1+β_2 "X" _2+β_3 "X" _3+⋯+β_n "X" _n	[1]

While LiR provides interpretable results and computational efficiency, its linear assumption limits its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships common in agricultural systems. As shown in Table 3, David (2023) demonstrated that LiR exhibited the poorest performance among the three models tested, with the highest training MSE (0.190) and lowest R² values (0.551 for training, 0.572 for testing). These results indicate significant limitations in LiR's ability to handle the complexities of rice yield prediction.
Artificial Neural Network model
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain's neural architecture, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems through learning from data. Mathematically, an ANN consists of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons), where each connection has an associated weight. The output of each neuron is determined by applying an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. This architecture allows ANNs to approximate non-linear relationships effectively (GeeksforGeeks, 2024a; Gill, 2024).
The study of David (2023) utilized a multilayer perceptron architecture with an input layer of 15 features, two hidden layers consisting of 20 and 10 neurons respectively, and an output layer predicting rice crop yield (RCY). The study incrementally increased the number of neurons in the hidden layers and evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R²). 
Table 3. Training and testing performance of three models from the study of David (2023).
Model	Training Performance Score	Testing Performance Score
	MSE	RMSE	MAE	R2	MSE	RMSE	MAE	R2
ANN	0.024	0.155	0.104	0.943	0.287	0.536	0.426	0.365
LiR	0.190	0.436	0.350	0.551	0.194	0.440	0.349	0.572
RF	0.032	0.179	0.133	0.924	0.159	0.399	0.295	0.647

This process identified optimal neuron combinations in the hidden layers for best data fitting. After determining these combinations, hyperparameter tuning was conducted to select an appropriate activation function and solver, specifically the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) solver.
Despite ANN's ability to model complex non-linear relationships, the study revealed significant challenges with overfitting. As shown in Table 3, while the ANN model achieved the best training performance with the lowest MSE (0.024), RMSE (0.155), and MAE (0.104) scores, as well as the highest R² score (0.943), it exhibited a dramatic decline in testing performance with an R² value dropping to 0.365. This substantial performance gap indicates that ANNs require larger datasets and careful hyperparameter tuning to avoid memorizing training patterns rather than learning generalizable relationships.
Other predictive models
Additional models have been evaluated for rice yield prediction, each with specific characteristics and performance levels. Jiya et al. (2023) evaluated Random Trees (RT), Logistic Regression (LoR), and Naïve Bayes (NB) alongside other models. As shown in Table 4, RT demonstrated exceptional performance with perfect scores for MAE (0), RMSE (0), RAE (0%), and RRSE (0%), achieving 100% accuracy. However, such perfect performance may indicate potential overfitting to the specific dataset.
Naïve Bayes ranked third among the models, achieving an MAE of 0.082, RMSE of 0.21, and 91.6% accuracy. Logistic Regression and ANN both showed comparatively lower accuracy at 75%, with LoR achieving an MAE of 0.15 and RMSE of 0.3, while ANN recorded an MAE of 0.16 and RMSE of 0.35.

Model	MAE	RMSE	RAE	RRSE	Accuracy
ANN	0.16	0.35	39.63%	76.37%	75
LoR	0.15	0.3	35.7%	78.2%	75
RF	0.14	0.17	33.02%	38.9%	100
RT	0	0	0	0	100
NB	0.082	0.21	19.22%	46.2%	91.6

Random forest ensemble learning approach
Given the limitations observed in individual models, LiR's inability to capture non-linear relationships, ANN's tendency to overfit, and the varying performance of other algorithms, ensemble methods like Random Forest have emerged as robust solutions for agricultural prediction tasks. Random Forest addresses many of the shortcomings of individual models by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (for classification) or the mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.
This method is based on the concept of bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and aims to improve the stability and accuracy of the model while reducing overfitting. (Breiman, 2001). The general form [2] of the prediction for classification is expressed as:
y ̂="mode" {h_1 (x),h_2 (x),…,h_n (x)}	[2]


where h_i (x) is the is the prediction from the ith tree and x is the input vector. In the case of regression, the prediction is calculated as the average of the individual tree outputs [3]:
y ̂=1/n ∑_(i=1)^( n)▒〖h_i (x) 〗	[3]

Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging). Bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, is a fundamental component of the Random Forest algorithm. It involves generating multiple bootstrap samples by sampling with replacement from the original dataset. Each bootstrap sample is used to train an individual decision tree. By aggregating the predictions of all trees, the model reduces variance and increases robustness (James et al., 2023a).
Feature randomization. Random Forest enhances model diversity by selecting a random subset of features at each node split. This feature randomization ensures that no single feature dominates the tree-building process. For a dataset with features, the number of features considered at each split is typically for classification and for regression. Splits at each node are determined using metrics such as Gini impurity or entropy in classification and mean squared error (MSE) in regression. In equation [4], Gini impurity is defined as:
G=1-∑_(i=1)^C▒p_i^2 	[4]

where p_i is the probability of class i at a given node, and C is the number of classes (Breiman, 2001; Karabiber, n.d.).
For entropy ([5]), which measures the uncertainty in the system, the formula is:
E=-∑_(i=1)^C▒〖p_i  log_2⁡(p_i ) 〗	[5]

where p_i represents the probability of class i at a given node (GeeksforGeeks, 2024b; Hastie et al., 2009).
In regression tasks, the model minimizes mean squared error (MSE), defined as ([6]):
"MSE"=1/N ∑_(i=1)^N▒(y_i-y ̂_i )^2 	[6]

where y_i are the true values and y ̂_i are the predicted values (Hastie et al., 2009).
Random forest classifier. The RF classifier is designed to address the classification problem, where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome. It works by generating an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the training data. The classification decision for a given instance is made based on majority voting among the predictions of the trees. (Hastie et al., 2009). Each tree is trained using a randomly selected subset of features and a bootstrap sample of the data. The random selection of features introduces diversity in the ensemble, making the model robust to overfitting and highly adaptable to noisy data.
Optimizing hyperparameters for a Random Forest classifier ensures its best performance for a specific dataset. The number of trees (n_estimators) is a crucial parameter; increasing the number typically enhances accuracy but also raises computational cost. Selecting the optimal maximum depth of each tree (max_depth) is another important consideration, as deeper trees capture complex patterns but may overfit if left unchecked.
The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split) determines how sensitive the model is to small variations in the data. Similarly, the minimum number of samples that must be present in a leaf node (min_samples_leaf) helps control the granularity of predictions, reducing the likelihood of capturing noise.
The number of features considered for a split (max_features) is a decisive factor in introducing randomness into the model. For classification, the square root of the total number of features is often the default, balancing performance and diversity. The choice of criterion, such as gini or entropy, affects how splits are evaluated.
Effective tuning requires techniques like grid search or random search combined with cross-validation to systematically evaluate various combinations of these hyperparameters. The choice of parameters can significantly impact the classifier's ability to balance bias and variance (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
Random forest regressor. The RF regressor leverages the same ensemble learning approach as the classifier. However, its primary objective is to minimize the error in predicting continuous values. This is achieved by averaging the predictions of individual decision trees. Each tree is trained using a bootstrap sample of the data and a randomly selected subset of features. By averaging the predictions, the regressor reduces variance and provides stable and accurate predictions (Hastie et al., 2009).
Optimizing the hyperparameters of a Random Forest regressor tailors the model to the dataset's specific characteristics. The number of trees (n_estimators) directly influences performance, as a higher number generally improves predictions but also increases computation time. The maximum depth of trees (max_depth) plays a pivotal role in controlling model complexity; overly deep trees may overfit, while shallow trees may underfit.
The minimum number of samples required to split a node (min_samples_split) determines when further splits are warranted. Higher values prevent the model from creating overly complex trees. Similarly, the minimum samples required in a leaf node (min_samples_leaf) regulates the resolution of predictions, ensuring that predictions are not overly sensitive to small variations.
The number of features to consider at each split (max_features) is critical in balancing prediction quality and computational efficiency. For regression, the default value is typically the total number of features. The default split criterion is mean squared error (MSE), which aims to minimize the overall prediction error.
Hyperparameter tuning is conducted through systematic approaches such as grid search or random search. Additionally, tools like cross-validation are used to assess the effectiveness of different hyperparameter combinations, ensuring that the final model is both accurate and robust.
Hyperparameter optimization and tuning strategies. The performance of Random Forest models depends critically on the selection of hyperparameters that control ensemble size, tree complexity, and feature randomization. Probst et al. (2019)  conducted a comprehensive review of Random Forest hyperparameter tuning strategies, identifying n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and max_features as the most influential parameters for model performance. Their analysis of over 250 datasets demonstrated that systematic tuning via grid search or random search consistently improved predictive accuracy compared to default parameter values, with performance gains particularly pronounced for small to moderate-sized datasets (n < 500). Bergstra and Bengio (2012) compared grid search and random search approaches for hyperparameter optimization, concluding that while random search offers computational advantages for high-dimensional parameter spaces, grid search remains effective for carefully selected ranges of critical parameters, ensuring exhaustive exploration without requiring assumptions about parameter importance.
The application of Random Forest to agricultural yield prediction has consistently demonstrated the importance of context-specific hyperparameter tuning. Jeong et al. (2016) applied Random Forest models to predict global and regional crop yields using climate and remote sensing data, exploring n_estimators values from 100 to 500 and finding optimal performance at 200-300 trees for datasets with 60-100 observations per region. Their study emphasized the trade-off between ensemble size and computational efficiency, particularly relevant for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Khaki and Wang (2019) compared deep neural networks and Random Forest models for corn yield prediction, reporting that Random Forest with tuned hyperparameters (max_depth = 10-20, min_samples_split = 2-5) achieved comparable or superior performance to deep learning approaches while requiring substantially less training data and computational resources. Jeong et al. (2016) specifically addressed rice yield prediction using phenological information from remote sensing, employing Random Forest with max_depth = 10 and n_estimators = 200 for a dataset of approximately 80 farms, demonstrating that moderate ensemble sizes and depth constraints effectively balanced model complexity and generalization capacity for small agricultural datasets.
These studies collectively established that Random Forest hyperparameter selection for agricultural yield prediction should consider dataset size, feature dimensionality, and deployment constraints, with systematic tuning methods providing substantial performance improvements over default configurations.
Machine learning pipeline architecture for agricultural applications
The implementation of Random Forest models in practical agricultural applications necessitates robust deployment frameworks beyond algorithmic performance. Google's machine learning pipeline architecture offers a standardized approach for managing the complete workflow from data ingestion through model serving (Google, 2024).
The machine learning (ML) pipeline framework provides a systematic structure for implementing machine learning solutions in production environments. As illustrated in Fig. 13, the architecture consists of four main components: Training pipeline processes raw data through data processing and model training to produce trained models; Validation pipeline evaluates model performance using test datasets and validation metrics to select optimal models; Data pipeline manages application data flow and dataset storage; and Serving pipeline delivers predictions to end users through applications with appropriate logging mechanisms.
This pipeline architecture ensures systematic management of the machine learning lifecycle, from initial data ingestion through final prediction delivery. The framework supports modular design principles that facilitate testing, validation, and iterative improvement throughout the development process, while maintaining data integrity and traceability at each stage.
The standardized pipeline approach addresses the complexity of transitioning research-grade machine learning models into production-ready applications, providing a foundation for reliable and scalable deployment across various domains including agricultural technology solutions.

In practical applications, Random Forest has been extensively used across various domains due to its robustness and versatility. For instance, in mobile applications, it is employed for predictive analytics, such as user behavior prediction, app recommendation systems, and fraud detection (Biau and Scornet, 2015). Random Forest models are also widely used in prediction apps for tasks like weather forecasting, disease diagnosis, and stock market analysis. These applications benefit from the algorithm's ability to handle large datasets with high-dimensional features and to provide feature importance scores, making it easier for developers and analysts to interpret results (Biau, 2012; Breiman, 2001). As such, Random Forest serves as a cornerstone algorithm for predictive modeling in modern technology.
Empirical evidence from multiple studies confirms Random Forest's superiority for rice yield prediction. David (2023) explored the environmental and agronomic factors influencing rice crop yields in the Pampanga River Basin, Central Luzon, Philippines. Using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), the research identified significant variables affecting rice yields. Among the machine learning algorithms utilized to predict RCY, Random Forest emerged as a robust and reliable model, outperforming Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network.
As demonstrated in Table 3, RF achieved superior performance with an MSE of 0.032 during training and 0.159 during testing, significantly lower compared to ANN (0.024 training, 0.287 testing) and LiR (0.190 training, 0.194 testing). Additionally, RF's R² values of 0.924 in training and 0.647 in testing demonstrate better generalization capability compared to the other models.

Complementing this, Jiya et al. (2023) reinforced the efficacy of RF by employing it alongside Logistic Regression (LoR), ANN, Random Trees (RT), and Naïve Bayes (NB) in developing predictive systems for rice yield. As shown in Table 4, RF achieved a strong balance between accuracy and error metrics, with an MAE of 0.14, RMSE of 0.17, and 100% accuracy, reinforcing its reliability in rice yield prediction.
The study conducted by Prasath et al. (2023) further reinforces RF's effectiveness, highlighting its application in predicting crop yields using a dataset of over 50,000 entries from 31 states and 537 districts. The dataset included features such as temperature, rainfall, area, crop type, and season (kharif, rabi, and summer). 
Additional features, including pH, conductivity, nitrogen, and electrical conductivity, were added to enhance accuracy and reduce the mean absolute error. The model achieved the highest R² value of 0.89, surpassing decision tree regression and gradient boosting algorithms.
Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 in the study of Prasath et al. (2023) illustrate the systematic approach, including the steps involved in data preparation and the operation of the Random Forest algorithm. Fig. 14 shows the crop prediction system workflow, while Fig. 15 provides an overview of the Random Forest algorithm where random K subsets are selected from the training dataset, decision trees are applied to each selected subset, predictions are made for each decision tree, the process is repeated for K subsets, and the average prediction of the subsets becomes the final prediction value.
The consistent performance of RF across multiple studies highlights its suitability for practical applications in rice yield prediction. RF's ability to capture intricate patterns and interactions among variables enables it to outperform models like ANN and LiR, making it the optimal choice for integration into mobile agricultural applications like GabayPalay.

While Random Forest has demonstrated superior performance in rice yield prediction (David, 2023; Jiya et al., 2023; Prasath et al., 2023), the integration of such advanced predictive models into practical mobile agricultural applications may still face significant limitations. Despite the documented benefits of machine learning algorithms and the growing adoption of mobile technologies among rice farmers (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022), gaps can persist between theoretical model capabilities and real-world application effectiveness. These limitations could become particularly pronounced when considering the challenges identified in current mobile agricultural applications, including issues with user interface design, limited offline functionality, and inadequate customization for local farming practices (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). Furthermore, the specific contextual needs of rice farming communities in regions like Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, where local environmental conditions, farming practices, and technological constraints may not fully align with existing mobile agricultural solutions, highlight the necessity for more targeted approaches.
The potential technological gaps and limitations in current agricultural applications suggest the need for developing contextualized mobile solutions that could address specific regional farming needs. The comprehensive review of literature on mobile agricultural technologies (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022) and predictive modeling approaches (David, 2023; Jiya et al., 2023; Prasath et al., 2023) can provide a robust theoretical foundation for addressing these challenges. This synthesis reveals that successful agricultural mobile applications must integrate accurate predictive models like Random Forest with user-centered design principles, offline capabilities, and localized content delivery. Understanding how these various components might be synthesized and applied to the development of GabayPalay could be essential for creating an effective, farmer-centered agricultural support system that bridges the gap between advanced machine learning capabilities and practical farming applications in the Philippine context.
