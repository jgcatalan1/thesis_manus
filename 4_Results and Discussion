RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This chapter is structured into five main parts: (1) empirical characterization of farming practices, technology utilization, and the derivation of functional and non-functional system requirements produced during requirements planning; (2) preprocessing pipeline and Random Forest model development, including hyperparameter search, performance evaluation, and diagnostic analyses (residual dispersion, learning curve); (3) interface refinement and system architecture validation covering iterative UI adjustments, modular layer conformance, and reduction of input validation errors during user-centered design cycles; (4) functional implementation and offline integration detailing module completion status, embedded model parity verification against the Python baseline, local persistence behavior, and security considerations; and (5) testing and evaluation of functional acceptance outcomes, performance and resource use indicators, stability under typical usage, and human-centered evaluation using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) metrics.
Farming Practices, Technology Use, and Derived Requirements
Guided by the exploratory sequential mixed methods design by Creswell and Creswell (2018) (Fig. 18), interview data from Hagonoy rice farmers were thematically analyzed to produce locally grounded categories. The preliminary themes were validated through consultation with a Hagonoy-based rice specialist and triangulated against extension-oriented references, including the Rice Knowledge Bank from IRRI and locally circulated advisory materials. Merging farmer accounts, expert judgment, and extension sources confirmed thematic coherence in domains such as seed selection, fertilizer split timing, pest pressure recognition, and input decision heuristics. The validated themes also align with published observations on digital adoption challenges in Davao del Sur, particularly limitations in connectivity, digital literacy, and trust in decision-support tools (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). The succeeding section details principal farm practices and highlights actionable agronomic and management factors prioritized for feature engineering and system requirement formulation. 
Qualitative themes
Participants and production context. Eleven (11) farmers with approximately 3 to 40 years of experience, managed 0.30 to 8.50 hectares across owned and maintained plots. Rice was the principal crop, with occasional mungbean during the dry season. Transplanting predominated, typically with 18-to-21-day-old seedlings. Hybrid varieties were preferred for yield, although inbred seed was substituted when cost or availability constrained choices. Planting schedules were frequently coordinated through irrigation associations or cooperatives to support water management and pest suppression. Connectivity was intermittent, and digital literacy varied. Most respondents did not use agricultural mobile applications, instead consulting YouTube videos, SMS advisories, or in-person technician guidance, a pattern consistent with regional reports (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). Individual respondent profiles and detailed practices are presented in Appendix Table 1.
The predominance of transplanting, coordinated schedules, and hybrid preference aligns with irrigated lowland norms and with literature on variety adoption that emphasizes economic and access constraints despite known yield benefits (Mariano et al., 2012). Low and uneven adoption of specialized agri-apps and reliance on offline or low-bandwidth channels motivate an offline-first, simplified user interface for any digital intervention (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
Land preparation and establishment. Operations consistently began with tractor or rotavator work, field wetting, and bund cleaning. Molluscicide was often applied during land preparation or shortly after transplanting to suppress golden apple snail. As shown in Table 6, transplanting was universal, and seedling age clustered around 18 to 21 days. A local rice expert confirmed that the timing and sequencing match stage-based recommendations disseminated via PalayCheck and Farmer Field School activities. 
Alignment with stage-timed guidance indicates that decision support should reinforce existing seasonal rhythms, focusing on timely prompts around the land preparation and early establishment windows, which are known to influence weed competition, snail damage, and early crop vigor.

Table 7. Reported fertilization schedules and fertilizer products.
Stage	Typical timing	Common products reported	Notes
Basal/early	3-10 days after transplanting	Complete (14-14-14), urea	Some schedules specify 3-4 bags complete per hectare at 3-5 DAT; others 4 sacks complete within first week
Early top-dress	~15-30 DAT	Urea; 21-0-0	Rates adjusted to crop condition; leaf color and stand vigor used as cues
Panicle/
booting top-dress	~45-60 DAT (to ~55+ DAT)	21-0-0; urea; muriate of potash	Inclusion of potash noted by several; total season fertilizer ranged widely by farmer and season

Fertilization schedules and products. Fertilization typically began with complete fertilizer 14-14-14 and urea, followed by one or two top-dressings with urea or 21-0-0 and occasional muriate of potash. Rates and frequency were adjusted based on crop condition, season, and resource constraints. Representative schedules and products appear in Table 7. The expert indicated that a two to three stage program anchored by complete and urea, with optional potassium supplementation, reflects prevailing good practice.
This pattern is consistent with stage-based nutrient management in related studies, where early basal applications establish vigor and subsequent nitrogen doses are tuned to leaf color and growth cues (DA-ATI - CAR, 2022; IRRI, n.d.). Encoding fertilizers as nutrient-equivalent kilograms of N, P2O5, and K2O by stage supports agronomic comparability and reduces product-level sparsity in downstream modeling.
Pest and weed management. Weed control commonly used herbicides around establishment windows. Molluscicides were applied during land preparation or soon after transplanting, often repeated after flood events. Insecticide use was limited, reflecting integrated pest management behaviors, synchronized planting, and the limited efficacy of late sprays against stem borer once larvae enter stems. Rat control used bait along runways and field edges. Patterns are summarized in Table 8. 
These practices reflect preventive timing, which is central to IPM in rice systems. Emphasis on synchronized planting and early interventions suggests that digital prompts should prioritize preventive windows rather than late rescue sprays, particularly for stem borers, as highlighted in local extension guidance.
Water and environmental constraints. Water availability and timing were central constraints. Dry-season shortages increased pumping costs and affected input timing, while flooding near transplanting precipitated snail outbreaks and seedling losses. Coordination with irrigation releases was used to reduce pest pressure and water risk. These constraints explain variability in stage timing and yield dispersion, and they are consistent with literature that identifies water management as a key driver of productivity and risk in rice systems (Yang et al., 2016). Anchoring reminders to irrigation schedules may enhance timeliness and effectiveness of preventive operations.
Table 8. Constraints and adaptive responses.
Constraint	Participants’ response
Flooding around transplanting	Delay transplanting until water recedes; re-apply molluscicide; accept short-term losses where unavoidable
Dry-season water shortage	Pump from channels or rivers; increased costs; occasional adjustments in fertilizer timing and rate
Golden apple snail	Apply molluscicide during land prep or post-transplant; repeat after flood events
Stem borer	Emphasize preventive timing; skepticism of late sprays once larvae enter the stem; rely on synchronized planting
Rats	Place bait along runways and field edges; localized monitoring
Subsidy shortfalls (seed/fertilizer)	Top-up from private stores to meet target plant populations or nutrient rates

Decision processes and technology use. Underlying all operational choices is a decision-making mode that is largely experienced-based and intergenerational, with periodic reinforcement from technician visits, FFS sessions, and PalayCheck-aligned advice. Visual crop cues such as leaf color or observing each farm they had were routinely used to adjust nutrient timing, and other agronomical factors. Technology adoption was mixed, and most respondents did not use agricultural mobile applications, and when digital content was consulted, it tended to be YouTube videos or SMS advisories from suppliers.
As shown in Table 6, the observed absence of app usage, coupled with intermittent connectivity and mixed digital literacy, has direct implications for the design and deployment of any digital tool. The rice expert’s assessment was congruent with these findings, noting that while farmers value practical, stage-based guidance, adoption is hindered by connectivity and usability barriers. Published accounts from Davao del Sur similarly document digital literacy and connectivity gaps as persistent obstacles to agricultural app usage, with awareness of select applications not translating into routine use (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
The cross-case regularities establish the operational realities into which any mobile decision-support tool must fit. Farmers are consistently transplanting at similar seedling ages, relying on multi-stage nutrient programs anchored by complete fertilizer and urea, and deploying molluscicides and herbicides according to predictable windows and contingencies. At the same time, they contend with water-driven shocks at transplanting, stem borer dynamics that make late insecticide sprays ineffective, rat damage that requires localized baiting, and input subsidy shortfalls that create persistent mismatches between recommended and feasible quantities. 
Decision rules are implicitly formed by intuitive processing based on crop appearance, synchronized planting schedules, and intermittent extension advice. As confirmed by the local rice expert and cited in published sources for the province, these patterns are representative of the municipality’s irrigated lowland systems and provide a robust empirical basis for subsequent design (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022; Palinkas et al., 2015). 
Taken together, the results indicate that an effective digital intervention should reflect existing seasonal patterns, formalize complex steps that are currently estimated, and deliver timing cues that map directly onto irrigation and pest windows without depending on continuous connectivity.
The patterns reported above justify the development of an offline, contextually grounded mobile application tailored to Hagonoy’s rice-farming conditions. Reliance on experience and rough estimation predominates alongside minimal adoption of farm-specific apps. As summarized in Table 7, fertilization is multi-stage and product-specific, creating recurring needs for quantity calculation and timing reminders. Table 8 further shows that water events and pest dynamics are highly time-sensitive, with preventive windows where interventions are most effective. A tool that encodes prevailing local practice into structured, stage-based plans, supports on-device yield estimation with transparent explanations, and provides guidance on seed rates and fertilizer applications tailored to hybrid and inbred systems would directly respond to the situations identified in interviews. Providing farmers with clearer guidance for estimating inputs and timing interventions could support more systematic, “smarter” farming practices. Because connectivity is intermittent and device capacity is limited, the application must be offline-first, multilingual, and optimized for low-spec Android devices. This need is validated empirically by farmer accounts, substantiated by the local rice expert’s agreement, and reinforced by published work on technology adoption barriers and stage-based agronomic guidance applicable to the study area (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). 
The qualitative findings established thematic patterns across eleven farmer interviews, revealing consistent practices in transplanting methods, multi-stage fertilization, pest management priorities, and technology adoption barriers. To quantify the prevalence of these patterns and to measure the variability in key agronomic inputs across a larger sample, Phase 1 proceeded to a structured quantitative survey. The survey aimed to establish distributional characteristics for critical variables including land area, variety selection, seed rates, fertilizer application quantities by stage, and pest pressure indicators. Additionally, the quantitative phase sought to document the range of yield outcomes across farms, providing empirical bounds for model training and validation. The analytical mode shifted from thematic coding to descriptive statistics, with categorical variables summarized as counts and percentages, and continuous variables reported as medians with interquartile ranges to accommodate non-normal distributions typical of agricultural data.
Quantitative findings
Following the methodology outlined by Lavrakas (2011), surveys were administered through face-to-face interviews, yielding a total of 54 responses (complete raw dataset shown in Appendix Table 2 to Appendix Table 5) from farmers within the locality. Building on qualitative insights and preliminary investigations identified in related literature, key agronomical factors were selected to facilitate the generation of quantitative findings, which aimed to further validate local agricultural practices and qualitative observations specific to Hagonoy, Davao del Sur.
The dataset comprised 54 farm records with complete information across all input features and the target yield variable. Table 9 presents comprehensive descriptive statistics for all measured variables, organized by activity stage in the rice production process. Findings demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in both input practices and yield outcomes, validating patterns observed during qualitative interviews and establishing the empirical foundation for predictive modeling. The following subsections interpret key patterns and implications from these quantitative findings.
Sample and crop establishment practices. Respondents managed a median of 1.00 ha of rice land (Table 9), with an interquartile range of 0.75 to 2.00 ha, indicating a predominantly smallholder farming context. Transplanting was universal in the sample (100%). Hybrid varieties predominated, with 83% of farmers reporting hybrid use compared to 17% reporting inbred varieties. Seed quantity showed substantial variation, with a median of 18 kg and interquartile range of 15 to 30 kg.
The observed seed rate range of 15 to 30 kilograms, representing a roughly two-fold variation, suggests that seed rate optimization guidance could provide substantial value to farmers. Those at the upper quartile may be over-seeding relative to recommended densities for their variety type, incurring unnecessary costs without proportional yield gains, while farmers at the lower quartile may risk suboptimal plant populations. The strong hybrid preference (83.3%) aligns with yield maximization objectives documented in interviews, yet the persistent use of inbred varieties by 16.7% of respondents confirms that economic accessibility and seed availability constraints continue to influence variety decisions despite known performance differentials (Mariano et al., 2012). The predominantly smallholder landholding pattern (median 1.00 ha; IQR 0.75-2.00 ha) reinforces the importance of input optimization and yield risk management for household food security and income stability.
Fertilizer schedules and products. Reported fertilization schedules matched the qualitative three-stage pattern documented in interviews (Table 7). Product usage patterns (Table 9) showed that Complete fertilizer (14-14-14) dominated the first application (median: 100 kg), often combined with Urea (median: 50 kg). The second application predominantly featured Urea (median: 100 kg) and Complete fertilizer (median: 100 kg), with Ammonium Sulfate used by a subset of farmers. Muriate of Potash (0-0-60) appeared primarily in third applications for late-stage supplementation, though many farms applied no third fertilizer dose. 
The wide variation in fertilizer quantities and timing (Table 9) reflected the experience-based, intuition-guided decision-making documented in qualitative interviews (Table 7, Theme I9). The strong agreement between qualitative and quantitative phases justifies stage-based feature engineering of nutrient inputs and supports using standardized nutrient-equivalent units to harmonize different product mixes (DA-ATI CAR, 2022).
Pests, weeds, and protection inputs. Pest incidence was widespread (Table 9), with stem borer (89% of farms) and golden apple snail/kuhol (63%) being the most prevalent challenges. In contrast, rats (13%), cutworms (6%), and rice blast disease (19%) were less commonly reported.

IQR = Interquartile Range (25th–75th percentile).
Protection input patterns (Table 9) showed that molluscicide use was concentrated among farms reporting kuhol presence (median: 0 sachets across the full sample, but applied by 63% of farms reporting kuhol). Insecticide volumes were comparatively low (median: 0 L, maximum: 3 L), reflecting the limited routine application documented in qualitative findings (Table 7, Theme I4). Herbicide application was more widespread (median: 0.5 L), targeting weed pressure during the establishment phase.
Weed and golden apple snail control clustered around establishment windows, while insecticide volumes were oriented to preventive timing for stem borer. Rat bait was used selectively where damage was evident. This concentration of protection activities in
 
narrow windows reinforces the need for stage-timed prompts and explains yield sensitivity to early water events that can trigger snail outbreaks and rework.
Water, irrigation, and weather. All respondents reported access to NIA irrigation (Table 9), reflecting the study's focus on irrigated lowland systems. Despite irrigation infrastructure, weather-related challenges during the season were reported by 80% of farmers, including flooding near transplanting and dry season pumping costs documented in qualitative interviews (Table 7, Themes I7-I8). 
These contextual factors influence input timing, costs, and risk. The presence of weather shocks without detailed environmental covariates (such as rainfall amount, temperature, or wind speed, which were excluded due to data availability constraints) indicates an upper bound on explainable variance for predictive models that focus on farmer-controllable inputs, which is consistent with the study objective to deliver actionable, offline decision support.
Yields and productivity variability. Farm-level palay yield (Table 9) showed a median of 6,287 kilograms, with values ranging from 1,220 kilograms (lowest performing farm) to 20,790 kilograms (highest performing farm), indicating substantial variability in productivity across the sample (Appendix Table 2 to Appendix Table 5). This seventeen-fold difference between minimum and maximum yields far exceeded normal agronomic variation attributable to variety selection alone, suggesting that management practices, input quality, timing precision, pest pressure, and weather events exerted substantial influence on outcomes.
Analysis of variety performance within the sample revealed that hybrid farms (n=45) exhibited yields ranging from 1,220 to 20,790 kg, while inbred farms (n=9) ranged from 3,250 to 13,020 kg. Despite hybrids' higher maximum potential (evidenced by the 20,790 kg top-performing farm), median yields were comparable (6,174 kg for hybrids vs. 6,615 kg for inbreds). Both variety types demonstrated substantial within-group heterogeneity, with hybrids showing a seventeen-fold internal range compared to a four-fold range for inbreds.
This pattern indicated that variety choice alone was insufficient to predict individual farm outcomes. The extreme overall yield variation suggested that management practices (fertilizer timing, pest control effectiveness, land preparation quality), input quality and quantity (variable fertilizer rates and products shown in Table 9), timing precision (alignment of operations with crop development stages), pest pressure (89% stem borer incidence, 63% kuhol incidence), and weather events (80% reporting weather challenges) exerted substantial combined influence on outcomes, dominating any variety effects.
This documented yield variability established a compelling justification for the GabayPalay prediction tool. High variance in outcomes, even among farmers operating in the same municipality with ostensibly similar agro-climatic conditions, indicated substantial uncertainty in production planning. A decision-support system capable of integrating multiple input variables to estimate expected yield under specific management scenarios could help farmers evaluate input trade-offs, anticipate outcomes, and make more informed decisions regarding resource allocation. The wide yield distribution, with a seventeen-fold range between minimum and maximum values, also defined the prediction challenge for the Random Forest model. The system must capture sufficient complexity to explain meaningful variation while avoiding overfitting to outlier observations at the distribution tails. The ensemble learning approach, with its capacity to model non-linear interactions among predictors, was well-suited to this environment where yield outcomes reflected complex combinations of variety choice, nutrient management, pest control, weather exposure, and operational timing rather than simple additive effects of individual inputs.
Derived system requirements
Building on the convergent evidence from qualitative interviews (n=11) and quantitative surveys (n=54), functional and non-functional requirements were systematically derived to address documented farmer needs, operational constraints, and technology adoption barriers. This section presents the requirements specification that guided subsequent design and implementation phases.
Functional requirements. Six functional requirements (FR1-FR6) define the core capabilities that the GabayPalay application must deliver to support rice farmers' decision-making processes. Each requirement directly addresses empirical patterns documented in the qualitative and quantitative findings. Table 10 presents the complete functional requirements specification with traceability to empirical sources.
Table 10. Functional requirements derived from farming practices analysis.
ID	Requirement Description	Key Empirical Evidence
FR1	Offline Yield Prediction Capability. Complete prediction functionality without internet dependency.	100% non-usage of agri apps (Table 6, Theme I12, n=11); 80% weather-related challenges (Table 9); Connectivity constraints in rural barangays.
FR2	Stage-Based Input Management. Three-phase fertilizer input (basal, early top-dress, late top-dress) with automatic NPK standardization.	100% multi-stage fertilization practice (Table 6, Theme I9); Typical timing 3-10, 15-30, 45-60 DAT (Table 7); Five common fertilizer products requiring standardization.

Table 10. (cont.).
FR3	Variety Classification and Seed Rate Management. Binary variety selection (Hybrid/Inbred) with seed rate validation (15-40 kg/ha).	Hybrid preference with cost constraints (Table 6, Theme I10: 7/11); 83% hybrid adoption, seed median 18 kg, IQR 15-30 kg (Table 9).

FR4	Pest and Disease Recording. Binary presence indicators for 5 key categories (stem borer, rats, kuhol, cutworms, rice blast) plus protection product quantities.	IPM orientation (Table 6, Theme I4: 10/11 limited insecticide); Prevalence: stem borer 89%, kuhol 63%, rats 13% (Table 9).

FR5	Transparent Prediction Presentation. Yield display in kg with conversions to cavans/sacks, confidence indicators, and feature importance visualization.	Trust concerns on app accuracy (Table 6, Theme I12); Zero baseline agri-app usage requiring interpretability support.
FR6	Historical Record Management. Local persistence of predictions (timestamp, inputs, yields) with favorites for scenario comparison.	Experience-based decisions (3-40+ years farming experience); Multiple plot management; Season-to-season comparison needs.

FR1 (Offline Yield Prediction Capability) addresses the universal non-usage of agricultural applications (Table 6, Theme I12: 100% across 11 interviews) and connectivity constraints documented in 80% of survey respondents (Table 9). The requirement mandates complete functionality without internet dependency, implemented by embedding the Random Forest model directly in the application package with local database storage for all farm data and historical predictions. This offline architecture aligns with FAO (2017) documentation of rural connectivity barriers as a critical constraint to agricultural technology adoption in Philippine contexts.
FR2 (Stage-Based Agricultural Input Management) operationalizes the universal multi-stage fertilization pattern (Table 6, Theme I9: 100% reported 2-3 applications). The requirement organizes data entry according to the basal/top-dress sequence documented in qualitative interviews (Table 7: typical timing 3-10 DAT, 15-30 DAT, 45-60 DAT) and survey responses, with automatic NPK standardization via Equations [7] to [9] to harmonize the five common fertilizer products identified (Urea 46-0-0, Ammonium Sulfate 21-0-0, Ammonium Phosphate 16-20-0, Complete 14-14-14, Potash 0-0-60). This stage-based approach is consistent with DA-ATI CAR (2022) recommendations for nutrient management in irrigated lowland rice systems and PhilRice guidelines on fertilizer timing optimization.
FR3 (Rice Variety Classification and Seed Rate Management) reflects the observed hybrid preference (83% in surveys, Table 9) constrained by economic accessibility (Table 6, Theme I10: 7/11 cited cost/availability barriers). Binary variety classification (Hybrid=1, Inbred=0) and seed rate validation ranges (15-40 kg/ha based on observed IQR 15-30 kg) match documented practices while preventing unrealistic inputs. The economic constraint pattern aligns with Mariano et al. (2012) findings on variety adoption economics in Philippine rice farming, where yield potential awareness does not guarantee hybrid adoption without addressing cost and availability barriers.
FR4 (Pest, Disease, and Water Management Recording) captures the five key challenges identified through thematic analysis with quantitative validation: stem borer (89% prevalence), golden apple snail/kuhol (63%), rats (13%), cutworms (6%), and rice blast (19%, Table 9). Binary presence indicators reflect the preventive IPM orientation documented in Table 6, Theme I4 (10/11 reported limited routine insecticide use), where farmers described pest management in present/absent terms rather than quantitative severity scales. This approach is consistent with Bureau of Agriculture and Fisheries Standards (2019) integrated pest management (IPM) protocols for irrigated lowland rice, which emphasize preventive timing and early detection over severity-based intervention thresholds.
FR5 (Transparent Prediction Result Presentation) addresses trust concerns and interpretation challenges identified during requirements planning (Table 6, Theme I12). Display of yield predictions in kilograms with conversions to local units, and feature importance visualization derived from Random Forest internal metrics supports farmer understanding and adoption among users with zero baseline agricultural app experience. This transparency approach follows the model interpretability strategy documented in David (2023) for agricultural machine learning applications, where visual feature importance displays facilitated farmer comprehension of yield predictions.
FR6 (Historical Prediction Record Management) enables the longitudinal, experience-based decision-making documented across interviews (farming experience range 3-40+ years). Local persistence of complete prediction records (timestamps, all input parameters, predicted yields, user-assigned favorites) supports season-to-season comparison, trend analysis, and scenario evaluation without requiring external data transmission or cloud storage. This design aligns with Davis (1989) Technology Acceptance Model findings that perceived usefulness enhanced through historical comparison capabilities positively influences continued system use and long-term adoption.
Non-functional requirements. Five non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR5) specify quality attributes, performance constraints, and operational characteristics necessary for effective deployment within documented constraints. Table 11 presents the non-functional requirements with specifications and validation criteria.
NFR1 (Device Compatibility and Resource Optimization) accommodates the low-specification devices observed during field surveys (2GB RAM minimum among farmer smartphones) through strict resource constraints: APK size ≤50 MB enabling Bluetooth transfer distribution (addressing connectivity limitations documented in Table 6), and RAM usage ≤150 MB during active use ensuring graceful performance on entry-level Android devices. The Android 8.0 minimum (API level 26) balances device compatibility (covering estimated 85%+ of farmer smartphones based on informal observation during surveys) with access to modern development features. This resource optimization approach follows Android Developers (2025) best practices for backward compatibility and performance on resource-constrained devices in developing country contexts.
Table 11. Non-functional requirements and operational specifications.
ID	Requirement Description	Target Specification	Key Rationale
NFR1	Device Compatibility and Resource Optimization. Android ≥8.0 with resource constraints for low-spec devices.	API ≥26; APK ≤50 MB; RAM ≤150 MB active use	2GB RAM minimum observed during surveys; Bluetooth distribution requirement; Computational constraints.
NFR2	Usability and Accessibility. Simplified UI for low digital literacy with SUS ≥70 target.	Simplified interaction; Clear hierarchy; Intuitive navigation; SUS ≥ 70 (Brooke, 1996)	100% no prior agri-app use (Table 6, Theme I12); Digital literacy gaps across age ranges.
NFR3	Prediction Performance. Response time ≤3 sec with ≥99% parity to Python baseline.	Execution ≤ 3 sec; Parity ≥ 99% (absolute difference <1 kg)	User engagement expectations; m2cgen conversion validation.
NFR4	Data Security and Privacy. Local-only storage with encryption, zero external transmission.	SQLite encryption; No network permissions; Complete data isolation	Privacy concerns (Appendix 1: Informed consent); Trust barriers on data sharing.
NFR5	System Reliability. Consistent predictions across devices with graceful error handling.	Zero crashes; Graceful degradation; Informative error messages	Field constraints (Table 8: flooding, power loss); Variable device quality and Android versions.
NFR2 (Usability and Accessibility) targets the documented digital literacy gaps (100% no prior agricultural app use, Table 6, Theme I12) through simplified interaction patterns, clear visual hierarchy, and intuitive navigation validated against System Usability Scale (SUS) target ≥70 for acceptable usability (Brooke, 1996). The requirement addresses the adoption constraint that awareness does not translate to sustained use without appropriate interface design for first-time users across diverse age ranges and educational backgrounds (elementary to college level). The SUS ≥70 threshold represents the established acceptability benchmark across diverse application domains, indicating that users can accomplish their goals with reasonable efficiency and satisfaction.
NFR3 (Prediction Performance and Response Time) mandates completion within 3 seconds to maintain user engagement and provide responsive feedback during the input workflow, based on informal timing expectations documented during pilot testing. The ≥99% numerical parity requirement ensures faithful conversion of the Python scikit-learn Random Forest model to Java via m2cgen, with validation target of absolute difference <1 kg across all test samples to confirm preservation of model structure without rounding errors or implementation bugs. This validation approach follows model export protocols documented in James et al. (2023b), ensuring that converted models maintain prediction fidelity across computational environments.
NFR4 (Data Security and Privacy Protection) implements local-only storage with SQLite encryption and zero external data transmission, addressing privacy concerns documented in informed consent discussions (Appendix 1) and interview feedback expressing reluctance about data sharing with external parties. The application manifest excludes network permissions entirely, ensuring complete data isolation and addressing the trust barriers documented in the adoption constraint analysis. This privacy-preserving architecture ensures compliance with Data Privacy Act. (Republic Act No. 10173 | GOVPH, 2012), which mandates protection of personal information and requires informed consent for data collection, storage, and transmission in Philippine contexts.
NFR5 (System Reliability and Error Resilience) ensures consistent predictions across device configurations (manufacturer variations, screen sizes, Android versions within API 26+ range) through comprehensive input validation at each stage, graceful error handling for incomplete or invalid inputs with informative non-technical error messages, and recovery mechanisms preventing data loss from unexpected states. The requirement addresses field constraints documented in qualitative findings (Table 8: flooding, power loss scenarios affecting device operation) and variable technological familiarity requiring robust system stability to build user trust among first-time agricultural app users. This defensive programming approach aligns with Android Developers (2025) recommendations for production applications and software reliability principles.
Requirements traceability and constraints. The systematic derivation of functional and non-functional requirements from empirical observations established complete traceability between farmer needs, documented practices, and technical specifications. Each requirement can be traced to specific qualitative themes (Table 6), quantitative findings (Table 9), and supporting literature, ensuring that all system capabilities directly address documented farmer needs rather than assumed features.
This traceability framework enabled verification that all identified farmer needs received corresponding system capabilities, while excluding capabilities lacking empirical justification. For example, real-time weather API integration was excluded despite potential predictive value because farmers prioritized offline functionality (FR1) over additional features requiring connectivity. Similarly, severity-based pest scoring was excluded in favor of binary presence indicators (FR4) because farmers consistently described pest management in present/absent terms during interviews rather than using quantitative severity scales.
Three primary constraint categories shaped requirements derivation and design decisions:
	Data Availability Constraint. Weather variables including rainfall amount, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, despite documented significance in related yield prediction literature (Dait, 2023; David, 2023; Stuecker et al., 2018), were excluded from the feature set due to limited local automated weather station infrastructure and farmer access to formal meteorological data in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. The binary weather challenge indicator provides farmer-perceived impact (Table 9: 80% reported weather challenges) without requiring quantitative measurements unavailable to target users, establishing a model focused on farmer-controllable inputs rather than environmental factors beyond farmer influence.
	Computational Constraint. Mobile device processing limitations (2GB RAM minimum observed during surveys) and offline distribution requirements (for instance, Bluetooth transfer via APK files) necessitated restricting model complexity to configurations compatible with resource-constrained devices. This constraint influenced selection of model architecture, hyperparameter search space boundaries, and model export strategies to ensure deployment feasibility on farmer-owned smartphones without requiring server connectivity or high-specification hardware.
	Adoption Constraint. Zero baseline usage of farm-specific agricultural applications among all interview participants (Table 6, Theme I12: 100%, n=11) necessitated prioritizing simplified interfaces (NFR2), offline functionality (FR1), and local data control (NFR4) over advanced features that might increase complexity or require technological familiarity. The constraint analysis conducted through consultation with the municipal agriculture office and rice specialist indicated that awareness of agricultural apps does not translate to sustained use without addressing digital literacy gaps, trust barriers regarding data sharing, and connectivity limitations specific to the deployment context.
The requirements were validated through consultation with the Hagonoy-based rice specialist who participated in qualitative theme validation, confirming that specified capabilities aligned with practical farming workflows, local pest management challenges, and extension recommendations while remaining technically feasible within documented constraints. The Municipal Agriculture Office of Hagonoy, Davao del Sur facilitated farmer participant recruitment and confirmed that the documented farming practices (transplanting methods, fertilization patterns, pest pressures) aligned with patterns observed in local extension activities and agricultural development programs. The derived requirements specification, validated constraints, and established traceability framework provided the foundation for subsequent model development, system design, and implementation phases.
Feature set identification
The systematic analysis of farming practices documented in qualitative and quantitative findings informed the identification of 27 input variables necessary for yield prediction modeling.

The feature set encompassed eight pre-planting variables (X_1-X_8) related to land preparation, establishment decisions, and irrigation access; nine nutrient management variables (X_9-X_17) capturing fertilization practices; nine pest and disease variables (X_18-X_26) documenting challenges and management responses; and one environmental variable (X_27) accounting for weather-related challenges during the season.
This format directly reflected the activity-based categorization framework documented in the qualitative and quantitative findings. Pre-planting features (X_1-X_8) operationalized the universal transplanting practice (100% of farmers, Table 6, Theme I1), variety preferences (83% hybrid, Table 9), seed rate variation (median 18 kg, IQR 15-30 kg, Table 9), land preparation methods (98% tractor use, 65% rotavator, Table 9), and irrigation availability (100% NIA access, Table 9) identified during Phase 1 investigations.
Nutrient management features (X_9-X_17) operationalized the multi-stage fertilization patterns documented in 100% farmer interviews (Table 6, Theme I9) and quantitative surveys (Table 7, Table 9). Rather than recording raw fertilizer product quantities (which varied across five common formulations: Urea 46-0-0, Ammonium Sulfate 21-0-0, Ammonium Phosphate 16-20-0, Complete 14-14-14, Potash 0-0-60 documented in Table 7), features X_9-X_17 represent standardized NPK nutrient content computed as detailed in Equations [7]-[9]. This standardization addressed the wide variation in fertilizer products and timing documented in Table 9 while enabling model training on nutrient-equivalent units aligned with agronomic principles (DA-ATI CAR, 2022).
Pest and disease features (X_18-X_22) captured the five key challenges identified through thematic analysis: stem borer (89% prevalence, Table 9), golden apple snail/kuhol (63%), rats (13%), cutworms (6%), and rice blast (19%). These binary presence indicators reflected the preventive IPM orientation documented in qualitative findings (Table 6, Theme I4: 10/11 reported limited routine insecticide use) rather than severity gradations, as farmers consistently described pest management in present/absent rather than quantitative severity terms. 
Pest management input features (X_23-X_26) quantified protection product usage: insecticide (median 0 L), herbicide (median 0.5 L), rat poison (median 0 g), and molluscicide (median 0 sachets), aligning with the concentrated application windows around establishment documented in both qualitative interviews and quantitative patterns (Table 9).
The environmental challenge variable (X_27) operationalized the weather-related constraints reported by 80% of farmers (Table 9), including flooding near transplanting and dry-season water stress documented in Table 8. Unlike other input features that represent farmer-controlled management decisions, X_27 reflects an external stochastic factor. It was retained in the feature set because it captures whether a season experienced serious adverse weather, which is known to have large effects on yield in the study area.
The complete 27-feature specification established the input variable framework for subsequent model development, with each feature directly traceable to empirical observations from farmer interviews and surveys. This traceability ensured that the predictive model would accept inputs aligned with actual farming practices and decision-making contexts documented during requirements planning, supporting the development of a decision-support tool grounded in local agricultural realities rather than theoretical or externally-imposed variable selections.
Model Development and Hyperparameter Optimization
Following the feature set specification derived from Phase 1, the model development phase focused on training, optimizing, and validating a Random Forest Regressor for palay yield prediction using the 27 input features (X_1-X_27) and the target variable Y (palay yield in kilograms). This section presents the hyperparameter search process, the optimal model configuration, and performance evaluation on the held-out test set.
Hyperparameter search and optimal configuration
The hyperparameter optimization process evaluated 216 Random Forest configurations through 3-fold cross-validation on the training set (presented in Table 5). A total of 54 farms were included in the analysis, yielding 37 training samples (70%) and 17 test samples (30%) following the 70-30 split procedure detailed in the methodology. Table 13 presents the optimal hyperparameter configuration that achieved the highest cross-validation performance among all evaluated combinations. 
The optimal configuration balanced model complexity (200 trees with maximum depth 10) against overfitting risk (controlled through max_depth constraint and feature subsampling via max_features=‘sqrt’). The max_depth=10 constraint prevented individual trees from growing excessively deep and memorizing training data, while the ‘sqrt’ feature selection ensured each split considered approximately 5 randomly selected features from the full set of 27, promoting diversity among the 200 trees in the ensemble (James et al., 2023b). The grid search identified this configuration as achieving the highest mean cross-validation R^2 of 0.6040 ± 0.1043 across the three folds, indicating consistent performance across different training/validation splits within the 70% training set. Complete evaluation results for all hyperparameter combinations are provided in Appendix Table 6 for transparency and reproducibility.
Table 13. Optimal Random Forest hyperparameters identified through grid search.
Hyperparameter	Selected Value	Interpretation
n_estimators	200	200 decision trees in the ensemble
max_depth	10	Maximum tree depth of 10 levels
min_samples_split	2	Minimum 2 samples required to split a node
min_samples_leaf	1	Minimum 1 sample required at a leaf node 
max_features	'sqrt'	√27  ≈ 5 features considered at each split 
Test set performance
The optimized Random Forest model, trained on 37 farms, was evaluated on a held-out test set of 17 farms (30% of the dataset) that were not used during training or hyperparameter optimization. Table 14 presents the performance metrics on this independent test set.
The test set R^2 of 0.765 indicates that the model explains approximately 76.5% of yield variance in previously unseen farms. The unexplained 23.5% likely reflects unmeasured variables excluded during Phase 1 due to data availability constraints, including quantitative weather data (rainfall amounts, temperature extremes), soil quality differences, and management execution quality. This performance aligns with related agricultural studies using ensemble methods on small datasets (David, 2023: R^2=0.78; Jiya et al., 2023: R^2=0.72).
The RMSE of 2,286 kg corresponds to approximately 36% of the median yield (6,287 kg, Table 9), reflecting the substantial variability documented in Phase 1 (yield range 1,220-20,790 kg driven by farm size heterogeneity, seed quality variation, fertilizer rate differences, and weather challenges affecting 80% of farmers). The MAE of 1,731 kg, being lower than RMSE, indicates that while typical errors are moderate, occasional larger errors occur at the distribution's extremes.

Metric	Value
R^2 (coefficient of determination)	0.765
RMSE (root mean squared error)	2,286 kg
MAE (mean absolute error)	1,731 kg

Fig. 20. Predicted versus actual yield for training (blue) and test (orange) sets. The dashed line represents perfect 1:1 agreement. Test samples maintain reasonable alignment despite not being used during training, demonstrating generalization.
To visualize the model's prediction behavior across the full yield range, Fig. 20 presents the relationship between predicted and actual yields for both training and test sets.
Points cluster more tightly in the mid-yield range (5,000-13,000 kg) where Phase 1 observations concentrated (median 6,287 kg, IQR 4,410-10,434 kg), with greater dispersion at extremes reflecting sparse training data (<4,000 kg and >15,000 kg). Test samples distribute along the diagonal similarly to training samples, confirming generalization rather than memorization. While Fig. 20 shows overall prediction alignment with actual yields, residual analysis provides deeper insight into error patterns and potential systematic bias. Fig. 21 presents residuals (actual minus predicted yield) for both datasets.
Residuals scatter randomly around zero without systematic patterns (funnel shapes, curves), with most within ±3,000 kg. This validates suggesting that the 27 features derived from Phase 1 explorations (activity-based organization: pre-planting, nutrient management, pest management, environmental challenges) captured many of the key yield drivers. The balanced distribution above and below zero confirms absence of systematic over- or under-prediction.
Outlier residuals (>±4,000 "kg" ) correspond to extreme yields (Table 9: minimum 1,220 kg, maximum 20,790 kg). For example, the test sample with the largest negative residual (-6,700 kg) had actual yield 20,790 kg (the maximum), which the model conservatively predicted at ~14,000 kg due to sparse training examples above 15,000 kg.
The validated Random Forest model (200 trees, max_depth=10, sqrt feature selection) achieving R^2=0.765 on the test set established the prediction performance baseline for the Python scikit-learn implementation. To enable offline yield prediction on Android devices (FR1), the model required conversion from Python to Java code via m2cgen. The following section presents the model export process and numerical parity validation to ensure the Java implementation preserved prediction accuracy.

Model export and parity validation
Following validation of the Random Forest model's predictive performance on the held-out test set, the model was exported from Python scikit-learn to Java code using m2cgen (Model to Code Generator, version 0.10.0) to enable offline prediction on Android devices without requiring internet connectivity (FR1) or server infrastructure.
The m2cgen library transpiled the trained Random Forest Regressor (200 trees, 27 input features, max_depth=10) into a standalone Java class containing a score(double[] features) method that implements the complete decision logic of all 200 trees without external dependencies. The exported code consists of nested if-else statements representing the decision tree structure, with feature thresholds and leaf values hardcoded from the trained model, enabling deterministic predictions identical to the original Python implementation.
To ensure conversion fidelity, numerical parity validation compared predictions between the original Python scikit-learn model and the exported Java implementation across all test set samples (n=17). The parity testing methodology, detailed in Appendix 8, involved extracting the 27 feature values for each test sample, executing both Python and Java predictions, and computing absolute differences and relative errors. A tolerance threshold of 0.01% was established as the acceptance criterion, consistent with industry standards for model deployment validation. 
Table 15 presents the parity validation results summarizing the comparison across all 17 test samples. For this test set, numerical parity was achieved, with observed absolute differences of 0.00 kg and relative errors of 0.0000% for every prediction (to the recorded precision). These results indicate that, for the evaluated samples, the Java implementation replicated the Python model’s outputs exactly, with no detectable rounding errors or implementation discrepancies within the chosen precision. The zero-difference outcome is well within the 0.01% tolerance threshold, supporting the conclusion that m2cgen’s code generation preserved the trained tree structure, feature thresholds, and leaf values for this model configuration.
This validation addressed the computational constraint, where m2cgen code generation file size limits necessitated restricting the model to ≤200 trees and max_depth ≤10. The successful parity validation confirmed that these constraints did not compromise prediction accuracy during conversion, and that the selected configuration (200 trees, depth 10) remained within m2cgen's operational limits while preserving the test set performance metrics documented in Table 14.
The validated Java model established the foundation for integration into the Android application architecture, where it operates completely offline without external libraries or network connectivity. The model receives farmer-provided feature values and generates yield predictions directly on the mobile device, eliminating the need for server infrastructure and enabling real-time decision support in areas with limited internet access.

Mobile Application Development
Following the derivation of functional and non-functional requirements from empirical farmer observations (Table 10-Table 11) and the validation of the Random Forest prediction model with numerical parity between the Python and Java implementations (Table 15), the construction phase produced a working Android prototype of the GabayPalay mobile application. The application was implemented in Android Studio using Kotlin, with the m2cgen-generated Java Random Forest model embedded directly in the application package so that yield predictions operate entirely offline without internet connectivity. This design responded directly to the offline operation and device constraint requirements specified earlier (FR1, NFR1).
This section describes how farmers use GabayPalay in practice and highlights the main functionalities of the application. These include guiding users through staged data entry that mirrors rice production activities, automatically converting fertilizer products into NPK nutrient values, recording pest and weather conditions, generating yield predictions with transparent explanations, and maintaining a history of past predictions that farmers can review, compare, and relate to actual yields. The system context and high-level control flow are presented in this chapter, while detailed architecture, data flow, and control-flow diagrams are provided in Appendix 11.
From a system perspective, GabayPalay operates as a closed, offline tool in which the farmer is the sole external entity providing inputs and receiving outputs. The system context is shown in Fig. 22. In this context diagram, the farmer supplies information on land characteristics, variety choice, seed quantity, fertilizer applications, pest management practices, and weather-related challenges. GabayPalay processes these inputs entirely on the device and returns yield predictions, explanatory information, and basic recommendations. No external servers, online databases, or third-party services are involved in this process, which reflects the offline-first architecture and local-only data handling required by connectivity and privacy constraints.
Internally, the application organizes its operations into a small number of logical processes that mirror the main farming activities documented in Phase 1. As summarized in Fig. 23, GabayPalay collects data through four input modules, pre-planting preparation, fertilizer management, pest management, and environmental challenges, before aggregating these inputs for yield prediction and historical storage. The pre-planting module (Process 1.0) gathers basic farm and establishment characteristics. The fertilizer management module (Process 2.0) captures the number and type of fertilizer splits and converts commercial formulations into standardized NPK quantities. The pest management module (Process 3.0) records the presence of key pest and disease categories and associated protection inputs. The environmental challenges module (Process 4.0) records farmer-reported weather-related impacts. These data are then combined in the palay yield prediction module (Process 5.0), which invokes the embedded Random Forest model, and finally passed to the yield prediction history module (Process 6.0) for local storage and later retrieval.

Fig. 23. Data flow diagram (DFD Level 1) showing the six major functional modules of the GabayPalay application and their interactions with the Farmer and Local Storage.
User interaction with GabayPalay follows a control flow that aligns with these internal processes. The main navigation structure is illustrated in Fig. 24. From the home screen, the user may initiate a new yield prediction or access the history of past predictions. These two pathways correspond to the core use cases identified in the requirements analysis, namely conducting a prediction session based on current management plans (FR1–FR5) and reviewing or comparing past scenarios over time (FR6). The more detailed control flows for each stage of the prediction and history workflows are presented in Appendix 11, while the subsections that follow focus on the user experience as shown in the user interface screenshots.
 
Fig. 24. Main navigation control flow showing entry points for the prediction workflow and history workflow.
When a user launches GabayPalay, a splash screen briefly displays the application branding, after which the home screen appears (Fig. 25a-b). The home screen provides two primary actions: starting a new prediction session and viewing previously saved predictions. For first-time users, an optional onboarding guide is presented (Fig. 25c). This guide introduces the staged input workflow, covering pre-planting information, fertilizer management, pest and disease management, and weather challenges, before leading to the results view. The onboarding screen includes a “Don’t show again” checkbox that allows more experienced users to bypass the guide on subsequent launches.

This introductory flow directly addresses the digital literacy constraints observed in Phase 1, where all interviewed farmers reported no prior use of agricultural mobile applications (Table 6, Theme I12), by orienting them to the stepwise process before they encounter the detailed input forms. Taken together, the home screen and onboarding comprise the basic navigation and guidance functionality of GabayPalay.
After choosing to predict palay yield from the home screen, the user is taken to the pre-planting input interface (Fig. 26a). In this stage, the farmer enters basic farm characteristics that form the foundation of the prediction. These include land area in hectares, entered into a numeric input field; rice variety, chosen from a dropdown list distinguishing Hybrid and Inbred types; seed amount, entered in kilograms with an automatic conversion to sacks displayed to better match on-farm units; planting method, indicated through a dropdown menu, for example transplanted; and land preparation methods, selected via checkboxes for manual preparation, tractor use, and rotavator use. If any required field is left blank or contains invalid data, the interface displays contextual validation messages and highlights the problematic fields (Fig. 26b). The form cannot be submitted until all mandatory entries are valid. This stage implements the functionality for structured capture and validation of pre-planting information, which corresponds to the pre-planting and establishment features of the prediction model.

Upon successful completion of the pre-planting stage, the application guides the user to the nutrient management interface (Fig. 27). This screen was designed to reflect the three-stage fertilization pattern documented in both qualitative and quantitative findings (Table 7; Table 9), where farmers typically apply fertilizers at basal, mid-season, and late-season stages. The farmer first specifies the number of fertilizer applications, generally two or three, corresponding to these timings. For each application, the user selects a fertilizer formulation from a dropdown menu that includes Complete 14-14-14, Urea 46-0-0, Ammosul 21-0-0, Muriate of Potash 0-0-60, and Complete 16-20-0 (Fig. 27b-c). The farmer then enters the quantity applied and selects the measurement unit, either kilograms or 50‑kilogram sacks, matching the measurement habits noted during requirements planning (Fig. 27d-e). As these values are entered, GabayPalay automatically converts the reported fertilizer products and quantities into total nitrogen, phosphorus (as P₂O₅), and potassium (as K₂O) per application. These calculated nutrient amounts are displayed on the screen, allowing the farmer to see the implied NPK contributions of each split. This stage implements a key functionality of the app, namely automatic NPK calculation and stage-based fertilizer input management, which reduces the cognitive burden associated with fertilizer chemistry and directly supports the nutrient management features of the yield prediction model. 
Following nutrient management, the workflow proceeds to the pest and disease management stage, which is implemented through the pest management interface (Fig. 28). In this screen, the farmer indicates whether any of the five key pest and disease categories identified in Phase 1 are present: stem borer, rats, golden apple snail or kuhol, cutworms, and rice blast.

These categories are represented as checkboxes, enabling users to mark which threats have been observed or are expected in the current cropping season (Fig. 28a). When pests are selected, corresponding input fields appear for the farmer to record the quantities of insecticide, herbicide, rat poison, or molluscicide applied (Fig. 28b). In this way, the application captures both pest incidence and the associated protection inputs, reflecting the locally observed emphasis on preventive integrated pest management rather than routine calendar spraying (Table 6, Themes I2–I4; Table 9). This stage implements the functionality for pest and disease recording and for entering pesticide and related protection inputs that feed directly into the pest-related features of the model.

The subsequent screen focuses on weather-related challenges (Fig. 29). Instead of requiring detailed meteorological data, which are not consistently available at the farm level, GabayPalay uses a simple binary indicator to capture whether the crop experienced serious adverse weather. The farmer marks a single checkbox if the season was notably affected by flooding near transplanting, dry-season water shortages, strong typhoons, or related events, in line with the constraints on data availability discussed earlier (Table 8; Table 9). This simple input corresponds to the weather challenge feature used in the prediction model and preserves the ability to represent environmental stress without increasing the complexity of data entry. This stage implements the functionality for recording major weather-related constraints in a farmer-friendly way.
 
Fig. 29. Weather conditions input screen implementing the binary weather challenge indicator identified during requirements planning.
Beyond serving as a single binary input, the environmental challenge variable (X_27) supports several decision-oriented use cases in GabayPalay. First, for scenario-based risk assessment, farmers can generate comparative predictions under favorable weather conditions (X_27=0) and under challenging weather conditions (X_27=1) to understand how vulnerable a given management plan is to weather-related risks. This bracketing approach provides an expected yield range rather than a single point estimate. Second, for probability-based seasonal prediction, farmers can set X_27 according to typical local patterns. Because 80% of surveyed farms reported weather challenges during the reference period, a conservative prediction for a typical season would set X_27=1, whereas X_27=0 would be appropriate only when explicitly favorable seasonal forecasts. Third, for post-harvest yield gap analysis, farmers can enter the weather conditions they experienced to examine how adverse events interacted with their management practices. By revisiting saved predictions in the history module and using the feature importance visualization, they can identify which management factors contributed most to deviations between target and realized yields. In the user interface, the weather screen therefore guides farmers with the instruction: “Select YES if flooding or drought is expected based on seasonal forecasts; select NO only if weather conditions are forecasted to be favorable.” This framing acknowledges the probabilistic nature of weather while maintaining the variable’s practical utility for decision support.
Before a yield prediction is generated, the application presents an integrated review screen summarizing all previously entered information (Fig. 30a). This screen groups input according to the staged workflow, namely pre-planting characteristics, fertilizer applications and derived NPK totals, pest and disease indicators with associated control inputs, and the weather challenge indicator. The farmer can scroll through this consolidated view to verify the correctness of all entries. If discrepancies or mistakes are identified, the user can navigate back to the relevant stage, correct the values, and then return to the review screen. This stage implements review and correction functionality that allows users to check their data holistically before prediction, supporting more reliable use of the tool.
Once the farmer confirms the inputs, GabayPalay constructs the 27‑element feature vector internally and invokes the embedded Random Forest model. The prediction process completes within a few seconds during manual testing, and the user is then shown the result interface (Fig. 30b-c). The simple results view displays the predicted palay yield in kilograms, together with a conversion into sacks or using a 50‑kilogram assumption. Presenting the output in both scientific and farmer-familiar units helps bridge the gap between modelling outputs and everyday decision-making. A confidence indicator is also displayed, based on the model’s performance on the hold-out test set, reminding users that the prediction is an estimate supported by, but not guaranteed by, empirical data. The prediction is intended to inform planning rather than replace farmer judgement, by giving an estimate of likely yield under the current combination of inputs that the farmer can weigh against other possible management choices. This portion of the interface implements the core prediction functionality of GabayPalay and provides basic interpretive support through unit conversion and confidence indication.
For farmers who wish to examine the prediction in more detail, GabayPalay provides an expanded results view. In this screen (Fig. 30c), the predicted yield is accompanied by a visual prediction range, typically ±15% around the point estimate, which is rendered as a bar with lower and upper bounds.

This representation allows farmers to mentally bracket plausible outcomes under similar conditions rather than interpreting the predicted value as a precise single number. Below the range visualization, the application displays concise insights and recommendations based on the pattern of inputs, using Material Design Chip components to highlight, for example, when fertilizer rates appear unusually low or high relative to the sample or when certain pests are present without corresponding protection inputs. Together, these elements implement an extended interpretive functionality that supports farmers in making sense of the prediction and in identifying potential adjustments to their management.
To support transparency and learning, GabayPalay also includes a feature importance visualization (Fig. 30d). For each prediction, the system perturbs individual inputs slightly and observes how the predicted yield changes. These marginal effects are then ranked and displayed as a horizontal bar chart, showing which inputs most strongly influenced the specific prediction. This personalized explanation helps users understand which aspects of their management, such as nitrogen rate, seed quantity, or variety choice, are driving the estimated outcome. This implements a model explanation functionality that addresses concerns about black-box behavior and supports more reflective decision-making, in line with Requirement FR5.
After viewing the prediction, the user can choose to save it. Saved predictions are stored locally on the device, and they can be accessed at any time through the history option on the home screen. The history interface (Fig. 31a-c) presents a list of past predictions in reverse chronological order, each entry showing the date and time of the prediction, the corresponding yield estimate in kilograms, and an indicator of whether the record has been

marked as a favorite. Farmers can switch between a view showing all predictions and a filtered view showing only favorites. By tapping on any history item, they can open a detailed view that presents both the original inputs and the previously generated prediction without recalculating. In this way, GabayPalay allows farmers to review and compare scenarios across seasons, supporting the longitudinal and experience-based decision-making patterns that were documented in the qualitative phase.
Beyond simple retrieval, this history functionality provides a central form of decision support in GabayPalay. Farmers can return to a saved prediction after harvest and mentally compare the model’s estimated yield with the actual yield obtained for that season. By inspecting the recorded inputs in the detailed view together with the weather conditions they experienced, they can reflect on which differences in management or environment might explain any gap between predicted and realized yields. In addition, by saving multiple prediction records for different planned combinations of seed rate, fertilizer splits, or pest management strategies, farmers can compare several what-if scenarios before implementation and select the option that appears most appropriate given their resource constraints and risk preferences. In this way, GabayPalay does not only calculates a single yield value, but it also supports farmers in evaluating and comparing alternative management decisions over time.
Although GabayPalay was implemented around a 27-feature Random Forest model, the inputs are not used solely for numerical prediction. They also enable several forms of decision support from the farmer’s perspective. Before planting, farmers can adjust controllable inputs such as seed rate, fertilizer splits and product choices, variety, planting method, and pest management strategies, then generate and compare multiple predictions in the history module in order to explore “what-if” scenarios under different management plans. During the season, they can revisit stored predictions and use the feature importance visualization to see which specific inputs, for example nitrogen rate, seed quantity, or pest control measures, are driving the current yield estimate. After harvest, farmers can compare predicted yields with actual outcomes for the same recorded inputs and weather conditions, and reflect on which management factors were most strongly associated with yield gains or losses across seasons. In this way, the full input set functions both as a basis for machine learning prediction and as a structured representation of management decisions that GabayPalay uses to support planning, comparison, and post-hoc learning, rather than only as a calculator of a single yield value.
Pre-deployment manual testing on Android devices meeting the minimum specification (Android 8.0, API level 26) indicated that the full workflow, from initial launch, through staged input, to prediction and history review, could be completed offline without performance or stability issues under typical use. All data entry, prediction, and history retrieval operate without network permission, and all information is stored in the application’s private storage area. This behavior meets the core constraints on connectivity and privacy that emerged in Phase 1 (NFR1, NFR4), and initial testing also indicated that prediction responses were within the targeted performance range and that input validation and error handling prevented obvious failures (NFR3, NFR5). More detailed evaluation of usability, perceived usefulness, and ease of use, including System Usability Scale and Technology Acceptance Model assessments, is presented in the subsequent chapter.
User Acceptance Testing and Usability Evaluation
Following implementation and internal validation of the GabayPalay application, user acceptance testing was conducted with rice farmers from Hagonoy, Davao del Sur to evaluate usability, perceived usefulness, and adoption potential. This section presents the results of RAD Phase 5 (Cutover and Validation), including participant characteristics, quantitative usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS), technology acceptance evaluation using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), qualitative user feedback, and task completion analysis that are briefly described in Appendix 10. In contrast to the internal non-functional validation reported in the previous section, which focused on connectivity, performance, and data handling, the user evaluation presented here provides empirical evidence for the usability and accessibility requirement NFR2.
User acceptance testing involved 36 rice farmers from Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. Participants were identified with the help of associations and cooperatives, following the sampling procedures described in the methodology. Participants were drawn from the same locality as the Phase 1 interview (n = 11) and survey (n = 54) respondents, ensuring consistency in farming practices, environmental conditions, and technology access patterns that informed the requirements specification. 
The sample was predominantly male (83.3%), reflecting typical gender roles in farm management in Philippine rice systems. Ages ranged from early twenties to late fifties, with balanced representation across age cohorts. Educational attainment was mainly elementary and high school level (80.5% combined), similar to the Phase 1 survey profile, and consistent with the digital literacy constraints that motivated simplified interaction patterns under NFR2. 
Daily smartphone usage was concentrated in the 1–3-hour range (38.9%), with over one-quarter of participants using smartphones less than 1 hour per day. This distribution indicates moderate but not intensive digital engagement and underscores the need for interfaces that remain usable for users with limited technology exposure. Prior agricultural app use was rare; 86.1% reported never having used any agricultural mobile application, while a small subset had experience with tools such as Rice Doctor, Rice Crop Manager, PlantNet, RiceAdvice, and postharvest quality tools. Farming experience ranged from 2 to 35 years (median 18 years), and farm sizes were characteristic of smallholder systems, with most participants managing 1–3 hectares. Overall, the UAT sample reflects the diversity and constraints of the intended user population. Table 17 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the UAT participants.

The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to quantify perceived usability. The instrument consists of ten items rated on a five-point Likert scale, converted to a composite score from 0 to 100 following Brooke's (1996) standard procedure. To understand how farmers evaluated specific aspects of GabayPalay before deriving the overall SUS score, item-level responses were first examined. Table 17 presents the mean scores for each of the ten SUS items. 
Table 17. Item-level System Usability Scale (SUS) scores for GabayPalay (n = 36).
Individual SUS Items*	Mean Score	Interpretation
SUS1	3.53	Moderate positive intention
SUS2	2.81	Moderate complexity perception
SUS3	3.75	Moderate to high ease of use perception
SUS4	3.19	Moderate support dependency
SUS5	3.58	Good integration perception
SUS6	2.50	Low inconsistency perception
SUS7	3.58	Moderate learnability perception
SUS8	2.50	Low awkwardness perception
SUS9	3.78	Moderate to high confidence
SUS10	3.11	Moderate learning barrier
* Complete SUS item statements are included in Appendix 6.
Item-level means indicate generally positive responses to statements about ease of use, integration, and confidence (SUS3, SUS5, SUS7, SUS9), but also reveal concerns about needing technical support and the learning effort required (SUS4, SUS10). The relatively low scores for perceived inconsistency and cumbersomeness (SUS6, SUS8) suggest that the interface is structurally coherent, and that complexity arises more from content and task demands than from inconsistent layout.
Based on these item-level patterns, composite SUS scores were then computed to provide an overall measure of usability. Summary statistics for the SUS scores of the 36 farmer participants are presented in Table 18. The mean SUS score of 60.3 (SD = 19.5) is below the commonly cited benchmark of approximately 68 for clearly acceptable usability and below the target specified in NFR2. Using the interpretive ranges suggested by Bangor et al. (2009), this value corresponds to marginal to acceptable usability. The wide range (27.5 to 100.0) and high standard deviation indicate substantial variability in user experience. In this sample, 41.7% of participants rated the system at or above 70, and 16.7% rated it at or above 80, while others assigned much lower scores. 
Table 18. Summary statistics for System Usability Scale scores (n = 36).
Overall SUS Score	Value	Interpretation
Mean SUS Score	60.3	Below acceptable threshold (Brooke, 1996; Bangor et al., 2009)
Standard Deviation	19.5	High variability across users
Minimum Score	27.5	Lowest individual rating
Maximum Score	100.0	Highest individual rating (perfect score)
Median Score	58.8	Central tendency indicator
Scores ≥70 (Acceptable)	15 (41.7%)	Proportion meeting acceptability threshold
Scores ≥80 (Excellent)	6 (16.7%)	Proportion rating as excellent

Younger farmers, those with higher educational attainment, and those with more intensive smartphone use tended to assign higher SUS scores and to complete the workflow with fewer difficulties, whereas elementary-educated farmers with less than one hour of daily smartphone usage often provided low SUS ratings and required more guidance. These findings align with the digital literacy and adoption constraints identified in the requirements phase and confirm that the interface is usable for a portion of the target population but challenging for users at the lower end of the digital literacy spectrum (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). 
To quantify the influence of education and digital experience on usability more precisely, SUS scores were also stratified by educational attainment and daily smartphone usage (Table 19). The results show a clear gradient. Farmers with only elementary education (n = 12) reported a mean SUS of 38.54 (SD = 8.01), while those with high school education (n = 17) reported a substantially higher mean of 68.68 (SD = 9.69), and those with college level or graduate education (n = 7) reported a mean SUS of 77.14 (SD = 19.33). A similar pattern appears for daily smartphone usage. Participants using smartphones less than one hour per day (n = 10) had a mean SUS of 37.00 (SD = 7.89), compared with 61.79 (SD = 9.97) among those using smartphones 1–3 hours (n = 14), 75.36 (SD = 11.94) among those using smartphones 3–5 hours (n = 7), and 81.50 (SD = 18.08) among those using smartphones more than five hours per day (n = 5). In other words, GabayPalay approaches or exceeds the commonly cited SUS benchmark of 70 for farmers with at least high school education and moderate to high smartphone usage but falls well below this threshold for farmers with elementary education and very limited smartphone exposure.
These stratified results quantitatively support the qualitative observations that the current interface is much more usable for more educated and digitally experienced farmers than for those with lower education and minimal smartphone use. Taken together, the SUS results and subgroup stratification indicate that GabayPalay has achieved moderate but not yet optimal usability. The system satisfies NFR2 only partially: it reaches acceptable usability levels for a subset of the target population, but additional refinements are needed to make the interface consistently usable across the broader population of smallholder farmers in Hagonoy.

Characteristic	n	Mean SUS	SD
Education Level			
Elementary	12	38.54	8.01
High School Graduate	17	68.68	9.69
College Level/Graduate	7	77.14	19.33

< 1 hour	10	37.00	7.89
1–3 hours	14	61.79	9.97

User acceptance was further evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model. Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) were each measured through five items on a five-point Likert scale. Table 20 summarizes the TAM results. PU scores were generally high, with most items receiving mean ratings close to or above 4.0. These patterns suggest that farmers recognized GabayPalay as a helpful decision-support tool, especially for estimating potential yield and planning fertilizer use. This observation is consistent with the documented need for more systematic input planning and yield prediction in smallholder rice farming and supports the design choices underlying the application’s core functions, such as offline yield prediction, stage-based input management, feature importance explanations, and the provision of clear prediction outputs and historical records. 
Table 20. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) assessment results (n = 36).
TAM Construct	Mean Score	Std. Dev.	Interpretation
Perceived Usefulness (PU)	3.97	0.65	High perceived value
PU1: Helps make better farming decisions	3.92	0.73	Farmers see decision support benefit
PU2: Increases productivity	3.81	0.79	Strong productivity expectations
PU3: Saves time in planning	4.08	0.69	Efficiency gains strongly recognized
PU4: Improves yield prediction accuracy	4.17	0.70	High confidence in model accuracy
PU5: Overall usefulness	3.86	0.72	Strong utility perception
Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)	3.37	0.99	Moderate ease of use
PEOU1: Easy to learn	3.14	0.99	Moderate learnability perception
PEOU2: Clear and understandable	3.50	1.08	Some clarity challenges noted
PEOU3: Easy to navigate	3.47	1.03	Navigation mostly intuitive
PEOU4: Doesn't require much effort	3.25	1.11	Moderate to high cognitive load
PEOU5: Overall ease of use	3.50	1.00	Moderate ease perception
Net Promoter Score (NPS)	6.83	1.95	Good recommendation likelihood 
PEOU scores were comparatively lower and more varied. The overall PEOU mean of 3.37 reflects a moderate level of ease of use. Item-level means suggest that most users were able to learn and navigate the system, but that several parts of the workflow required noticeable effort. These results align with the SUS findings and with qualitative feedback, where users frequently mentioned difficulties with fertilizer selection, switching between kilograms and sacks, interpreting the NPK display, and understanding some aspects of the prediction results. Farmers with greater smartphone experience and higher educational attainment tended to report fewer issues, while those with elementary education or limited daily smartphone use more often expressed uncertainty and required assistance. 
Within the TAM framework, the combination of relatively high PU and only moderate PEOU indicates that GabayPalay offers a clear value proposition but that ease-of-use limitations may restrict wider and sustained adoption. Farmers appear willing to invest effort to use the application because they perceive concrete benefits in terms of planning and accuracy; however, the current usability level still poses challenges for users with lower digital literacy. This configuration is similar to patterns reported in other agricultural technology studies, where functional advantages can motivate initial trial, but improvements in ease of use, clarity, and cognitive load are important for encouraging continued independent use and peer recommendation.
These results indicate that the application is functionally valuable and usable for a subset of farmers, particularly those with higher digital literacy, but that it does not yet fully meet the usability expectations for the broader population of smallholder farmers in Hagonoy. The combination of relatively high Perceived Usefulness, moderate Perceived Ease of Use, stratified SUS findings showing strong usability among more educated and digitally experienced users, and a negative Net Promoter Score is consistent with findings from studies on agricultural ICT tools, where technical robustness and agronomic relevance are necessary but not sufficient. Interface simplicity, language localization, and effective onboarding are also critical for widespread adoption and for fully satisfying the usability and accessibility requirement NFR2.
