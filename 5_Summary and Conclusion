SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

This study developed and evaluated GabayPalay, an offline Android application that predicts potential palay yield from farmer‑controlled agronomic factors in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. The work combined investigation of local farming practices and technology use, development of a Random Forest model, and user acceptance testing with farmers who had little or no prior experience with agricultural applications.
Interviews and surveys showed that farmers relied mainly on experience, seasonal rhythms, and occasional technician advice, with no reported use of agricultural mobile applications (I12). Their practices followed consistent patterns such as transplanting‑based establishment, three‑stage fertilization, and mostly preventive pest management targeting a few key pests (I2 to I4, I10 to I11). Within these patterns, important management aspects for higher productivity included optimized seed rates, more precise timing and splitting of fertilizer applications, and targeted pest control around establishment. These findings guided functional requirements FR1 to FR6 and non‑functional requirements NFR1 to NFR5 and led to a 27‑feature input set centered on variables that farmers can observe and control, plus a simple indicator of environmental challenges.
Within this context, a Random Forest regressor was trained on the 27‑feature set and achieved R² = 0.765 on a held‑out test set, explaining about three quarters of the variance in reported yields. A configuration that balanced accuracy and resource constraints was converted to Java with m2cgen, enabling fully offline prediction on low‑ to mid‑range Android devices in line with NFR1 and NFR4. GabayPalay implemented offline yield prediction (FR1), stage‑based fertilizer input using commercial products with internal NPK computation (FR2), and pest and weather inputs aligned with local practice (FR3 and FR4). It also included feature importance visualization (FR5) and a history module for storing past sessions and comparing scenarios (FR6), while meeting size, performance, and offline storage constraints (NFR1, NFR3, NFR4). Activity‑based navigation and staged input were designed to support NFR2 under low average formal education and variable smartphone experience.
User acceptance testing with 36 farmers showed that GabayPalay was recognized as useful but not universally easy to use. The mean System Usability Scale (SUS) score was 60.3, below the commonly cited acceptability threshold, with a clear gradient by education and smartphone use. Farmers with only elementary education averaged 38.54, high school graduates 68.68, and those with college‑level or higher education 77.14. By daily smartphone usage, SUS increased from 37.00 for users with less than one hour per day to 81.50 for those using smartphones more than five hours. Thus, GabayPalay approached or exceeded the benchmark for farmers with at least high school education and moderate to intensive smartphone use but fell well below it for farmers with limited education and minimal digital exposure. Technology Acceptance Model results complemented these findings: Perceived Usefulness was high, especially for yield prediction and planning, but Perceived Ease of Use was only moderate. The Net Promoter Score was negative, and qualitative feedback pointed to English‑only text, technical terminology, and unit conversion as major barriers. Many participants explicitly requested a Bisaya version and simpler explanations, indicating that NFR2 is only partially met.
Overall, the study showed that a model trained on farmer‑reported management data can provide useful yield predictions in a purely offline, mobile environment and that this model can be embedded in an application whose workflow and features reflect local practices and constraints (I1 to I12, FR1 to FR6, NFR1 to NFR5). GabayPalay delivered recognized value for planning and decision support, particularly for more educated and digitally experienced farmers, but predictive accuracy and offline capability alone were not sufficient for inclusive use across the full target population.
Future work on the modeling side should prioritize larger and more diverse datasets and the inclusion of selected environmental variables. Increasing the number of farms and seasons and adding accessible environmental summaries (for example, rainfall and temperature per cropping period) would improve robustness and help explain yield variation due to climate, provided that updates remain compatible with an offline‑first design. On the application side, priorities for the next iteration include Bisaya localization, richer contextual help, and targeted interface refinement. Translating interface content into locally familiar language, adding concise on‑screen guidance and visual cues, simplifying fertilizer and unit entry, and allowing farmers to record actual yield for each prediction in the history can reduce cognitive load and support comparison between predicted and realized yields. Longer‑term studies, in coordination with cooperatives and extension workers, can then examine how GabayPalay app is used over multiple seasons and how design and training strategies affect independent use, trust, and impact on management decisions.
