Rice remains a critical staple for the Philippines, yet smallholder farmers continue to face yield variability driven by suboptimal input management and limited access to decision support tools. This study developed and evaluated an offline Android application that predicts palay yield based on farmer-controlled agronomic inputs in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, with the aim of assisting farmers in planning and optimizing production decisions while supporting UN SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production. An exploratory sequential mixed-method design was used, beginning with qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to document farming practices, technology use, and key productivity factors. Findings revealed universal transplanting, multi-stage fertilization with two to three applications per season, preventive pest management, substantial yield variability, and zero baseline use of agricultural mobile applications despite moderate smartphone ownership. Using farmer-reported management data from 54 rice cropping period, a Random Forest regression model was trained and tuned to predict yield, achieving R² = 0.765 on a held-out test set and outperforming a linear regression baseline. The model was embedded into an offline-capable mobile interface through code conversion, enabling on-device predictions without internet connectivity. User acceptance testing with 36 farmers showed that all planned functional features were operational; however, the mean System Usability Scale score of 60.3 indicated below-target usability, while Technology Acceptance Model results showed high perceived usefulness but only moderate perceived ease of use, and the Net Promoter Score was negative. Qualitative feedback identified English-only interfaces, technical terminology, and unit conversion as major barriers, particularly for farmers with lower educational attainment. The results indicate that localized, offline machine learning tools can provide credible yield predictions using farmer-reported data, and that with vernacular localization, interface simplification, and integration with extension-led training and support, such tools have promising potential to contribute to more informed and sustainable rice production decisions in smallholder contexts.
