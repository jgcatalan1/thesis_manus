INTRODUCTION

The Philippines consistently ranks as one of the top rice producers globally, maintaining its position as the 8th largest producer, trailing behind other Southeast Asian countries (DA Press Office, 2022). As rice serves as the country’s staple food, the Philippines also ranks among the largest global consumers of rice. Approximately 90% of the world’s rice is produced and consumed in Asia (Balita, 2024a; Matic Hub, 2021). In 2023, the country’s palay production peaked at 20.06 million metric tons (Balita, 2024a). In 2024, 4.81 million hectares of harvested land yielded 19.96 million metric tons, valued at Php 403.89 billion (PCAARRD’s Industry Strategic Science and Technology Programs, 2024). 
Mindanao plays a critical role in Philippine agriculture, contributing 36.7 percent to the total value of agricultural and fisheries production in 2023 at constant 2018 prices, second only to Luzon at 45.5 percent (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2024). The region also led in crop production, accounting for 42.2 percent of national output, narrowly exceeding Luzon’s share. Within Mindanao, the Davao Region is a significant contributor to rice production, with an average palay yield of 4.54 metric tons per hectare in 2024 (Philippine Rice Research Institute, n.d.). Davao del Sur consistently demonstrates superior yield performance, averaging 4.84 metric tons per hectare.
Among the municipalities in Davao del Sur, Hagonoy serves as a significant hub for rice production within the region. In 2023, it ranked fourth in the province for yield performance, surpassing five other municipalities (Philippine Rice Information System (PRiSM), n.d.). Hagonoy consistently outperforms both regional and provincial yield averages, with a record of 6.96 metric tons per hectare, compared to the provincial average of just over 5 metric tons and the regional average of 4 metric tons per hectare (Hondrade, 2007; PRiSM, n.d.). In 2023, its average yield remained robust at 4.97 metric tons per hectare. These exceptional figures establish Hagonoy as a high-performing municipality, underscoring its strategic importance as a focal area for implementing advanced rice production technologies. This study’s rationale centers on advancing sustainable rice production decision making in Hagonoy farmers.
Enhancing rice productivity necessitates the precise management of production inputs to mitigate output variability. Research indicates that many rice farms overutilize pesticides, seeds, and machinery relative to their scale of production, suggesting that operational expansion could improve efficiency (Yang et al., 2016). In the Philippine context, productivity heavily depends on pre-planting, cultivation, and harvesting practices. Achieving self-sufficiency in rice production requires strategies such as minimizing food waste, diversifying consumption, maintaining buffer stocks, and ensuring access to crop insurance (Vicente et al., 2023). While technological advancements, including new rice varieties, have improved productivity and reduced costs (Bautista and Javier, 2005), traditional farming methods are increasingly inadequate in addressing emerging challenges such as climate change, pest infestations, and rising production costs (FAO, 2017). Philippine rice production efficiency remains low at 54.6% compared to other developing nations, constrained by rising input costs, land rent, and other factors (Koirala et al., 2013). These challenges highlight the need for technology-driven solutions to complement traditional practices (FAO, 2017).
Technological innovations, including high-yielding rice varieties, mechanized equipment, and information and communication technology (ICT) tools, provide opportunities to enhance farm efficiency. ICT solutions enable data-driven decision-making through real-time insights (Tallada, 2019). In Davao del Sur, farmers leverage agricultural applications such as Binhing Palay, e-Damuhan, Leaf Color Computing (LCC), and Rice Doctor, among others, to address key aspects of rice production, including pest management and variety selection (Angchay et al., 2024).
Despite the proliferation of these technologies, barriers such as limited digital literacy, inadequate internet connectivity, and resistance to technology adoption persist, particularly in underserved rural communities (Philippine Institute for Development Studies et al., 2023). While some farmers in Davao del Sur have reported enhanced efficiency and income following agri-app training, these challenges continue to limit the widespread adoption of existing tools (Angchay et al., 2024). 
To address these limitations, the proposed mobile application is designed to function offline, ensuring accessibility in areas with unreliable internet connectivity. Its simplified user interface is tailored to accommodate users with limited digital literacy, providing a more inclusive technological solution. By integrating these features, the application is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap in technology adoption among underserved farming populations.
This study primarily supports SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, which emphasizes the importance of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. By developing a mobile application that predicts the potential yield of palay based on agronomical factors, the study aims to enhance resource efficiency and minimize waste in rice production. By helping farmers in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, manage their resources more effectively, the application seeks to optimize production processes, and ensure that agricultural practices contribute to sustainable food systems. Ultimately, this approach not only aids in maximizing productivity but also promotes environmental sustainability, as it encourages responsible use of agricultural input and reduces the negative impact of farming on natural resources. Through these efforts, the study aligns with global initiatives to foster sustainable practices in agriculture and ensure that food production meets the needs of the present without compromising future generations.
Objective of the Study
The goal of the study was to develop a mobile application designed to predict the potential yield of palay based on agronomic factors that influenced rice production. This tool aimed to help farmers in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, by providing actionable insights to manage these factors effectively and predict the potential yield. Specifically, the study aimed to: 
1.	investigate the lack of mobile application usage among farmers, while identifying their current farming practices and determining key factors that could lead to improved rice productivity through face-to-face interviews using standardized questions;
2.	design and implement a mobile application tailored to the findings of the investigation, utilizing the Random Forest model for predicting the potential rice yield; and
3.	evaluate the usability of the mobile application using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and to assess its user acceptance through the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) constructs of Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use.
 
Scope and Limitations
The scope of this study was limited to rice farmers within the municipality of Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, focusing on their local practices and agronomic inputs. Data were collected using purposive sampling and face-to-face surveys, ensuring representation of diverse farm sizes and experiences. The mobile application was built specifically for Android devices with offline functionality, addressing local connectivity challenges but potentially limiting accessibility for farmers without compatible devices or sufficient digital skills.
This study excluded variables such as weather conditions, market prices, and other environmental or socio-economic factors due to limited data accessibility and to maintain focus on inputs directly observable and manageable by farmers, such as seed variety, fertilizer usage, pest management, and irrigation. The exclusion of these variables meant the findings may not be generalizable to other regions or cropping seasons, and the recommendations were tailored to Hagonoy’s unique context. Data collection occurred within a single cropping season, so results may not capture year-to-year variability.
The reliance on self-reported data may have introduced response bias, and while every effort was made to ensure data accuracy, some degree of bias was unavoidable. All participants provided informed consent, and personal information was kept confidential in compliance with ethical standards. This approach was supported by recent studies (Ajayi et al., 2024) that emphasized empowering farmers to utilize accessible data for decision-making at the local level.
