RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This chapter is structured into five main parts: (1) empirical characterization of farming practices, technology utilization, and the derivation of functional and non-functional system requirements produced during requirements planning; (2) preprocessing pipeline and Random Forest model development, including hyperparameter search, performance evaluation, and diagnostic analyses (residual dispersion, learning curve); (3) interface refinement and system architecture validation covering iterative UI adjustments, modular layer conformance, and reduction of input validation errors during user-centered design cycles; (4) functional implementation and offline integration detailing module completion status, embedded model parity verification against the Python baseline, local persistence behavior, and security considerations; and (5) testing and evaluation of functional acceptance outcomes, performance and resource use indicators, stability under typical usage, and human-centered evaluation using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) metrics.
Farming Practices, Technology Use, and Derived Requirements
Guided by the exploratory sequential mixed methods design by Creswell and Creswell (2018) (Fig. 18), interview data from Hagonoy rice farmers were thematically analyzed to produce locally grounded categories. The preliminary themes were validated through consultation with a Hagonoy-based rice specialist and triangulated against extension-oriented references, including the Rice Knowledge Bank from IRRI and locally circulated advisory materials. Merging farmer accounts, expert judgment, and extension sources confirmed thematic coherence in domains such as seed selection, fertilizer split timing, pest pressure recognition, and input decision heuristics. The validated themes also align with published observations on digital adoption challenges in Davao del Sur, particularly limitations in connectivity, digital literacy, and trust in decision-support tools (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). The succeeding section details principal farm practices and highlights actionable agronomic and management factors prioritized for feature engineering and system requirement formulation. 
Qualitative themes
Participants and production context. Eleven (11) farmers with approximately 3 to 40 years of experience, managed 0.30 to 8.50 hectares across owned and maintained plots. Rice was the principal crop, with occasional mungbean during the dry season. Transplanting predominated, typically with 18-to-21-day-old seedlings. Hybrid varieties were preferred for yield, although inbred seed was substituted when cost or availability constrained choices. Planting schedules were frequently coordinated through irrigation associations or cooperatives to support water management and pest suppression. Connectivity was intermittent, and digital literacy varied. Most respondents did not use agricultural mobile applications, instead consulting YouTube videos, SMS advisories, or in-person technician guidance, a pattern consistent with regional reports (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). Individual respondent profiles and detailed practices are presented in Appendix Table 1.
The predominance of transplanting, coordinated schedules, and hybrid preference aligns with irrigated lowland norms and with literature on variety adoption that emphasizes economic and access constraints despite known yield benefits (Mariano et al., 2012). Low and uneven adoption of specialized agri-apps and reliance on offline or low-bandwidth channels motivate an offline-first, simplified user interface for any digital intervention (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
Land preparation and establishment. Operations consistently began with tractor or rotavator work, field wetting, and bund cleaning. Molluscicide was often applied during land preparation or shortly after transplanting to suppress golden apple snail. As shown in Table 6, transplanting was universal, and seedling age clustered around 18 to 21 days. A local rice expert confirmed that the timing and sequencing match stage-based recommendations disseminated via PalayCheck and Farmer Field School activities. 
Alignment with stage-timed guidance indicates that decision support should reinforce existing seasonal rhythms, focusing on timely prompts around the land preparation and early establishment windows, which are known to influence weed competition, snail damage, and early crop vigor.

Table 7. Reported fertilization schedules and fertilizer products.
Stage	Typical timing	Common products reported	Notes
Basal/early	3-10 days after transplanting	Complete (14-14-14), urea	Some schedules specify 3-4 bags complete per hectare at 3-5 DAT; others 4 sacks complete within first week
Early top-dress	~15-30 DAT	Urea; 21-0-0	Rates adjusted to crop condition; leaf color and stand vigor used as cues
Panicle/
booting top-dress	~45-60 DAT (to ~55+ DAT)	21-0-0; urea; muriate of potash	Inclusion of potash noted by several; total season fertilizer ranged widely by farmer and season

Fertilization schedules and products. Fertilization typically began with complete fertilizer 14-14-14 and urea, followed by one or two top-dressings with urea or 21-0-0 and occasional muriate of potash. Rates and frequency were adjusted based on crop condition, season, and resource constraints. Representative schedules and products appear in Table 7. The expert indicated that a two to three stage program anchored by complete and urea, with optional potassium supplementation, reflects prevailing good practice.
This pattern is consistent with stage-based nutrient management in related studies, where early basal applications establish vigor and subsequent nitrogen doses are tuned to leaf color and growth cues (DA-ATI - CAR, 2022; IRRI, n.d.). Encoding fertilizers as nutrient-equivalent kilograms of N, P2O5, and K2O by stage supports agronomic comparability and reduces product-level sparsity in downstream modeling.
Pest and weed management. Weed control commonly used herbicides around establishment windows. Molluscicides were applied during land preparation or soon after transplanting, often repeated after flood events. Insecticide use was limited, reflecting integrated pest management behaviors, synchronized planting, and the limited efficacy of late sprays against stem borer once larvae enter stems. Rat control used bait along runways and field edges. Patterns are summarized in Table 8. 
These practices reflect preventive timing, which is central to IPM in rice systems. Emphasis on synchronized planting and early interventions suggests that digital prompts should prioritize preventive windows rather than late rescue sprays, particularly for stem borers, as highlighted in local extension guidance.
Water and environmental constraints. Water availability and timing were central constraints. Dry-season shortages increased pumping costs and affected input timing, while flooding near transplanting precipitated snail outbreaks and seedling losses. Coordination with irrigation releases was used to reduce pest pressure and water risk. These constraints explain variability in stage timing and yield dispersion, and they are consistent with literature that identifies water management as a key driver of productivity and risk in rice systems (Yang et al., 2016). Anchoring reminders to irrigation schedules may enhance timeliness and effectiveness of preventive operations.
Table 8. Constraints and adaptive responses.
Constraint	Participants’ response
Flooding around transplanting	Delay transplanting until water recedes; re-apply molluscicide; accept short-term losses where unavoidable
Dry-season water shortage	Pump from channels or rivers; increased costs; occasional adjustments in fertilizer timing and rate
Golden apple snail	Apply molluscicide during land prep or post-transplant; repeat after flood events
Stem borer	Emphasize preventive timing; skepticism of late sprays once larvae enter the stem; rely on synchronized planting
Rats	Place bait along runways and field edges; localized monitoring
Subsidy shortfalls (seed/fertilizer)	Top-up from private stores to meet target plant populations or nutrient rates

Decision processes and technology use. Underlying all operational choices is a decision-making mode that is largely experienced-based and intergenerational, with periodic reinforcement from technician visits, FFS sessions, and PalayCheck-aligned advice. Visual crop cues such as leaf color or observing each farm they had were routinely used to adjust nutrient timing, and other agronomical factors. Technology adoption was mixed, and most respondents did not use agricultural mobile applications, and when digital content was consulted, it tended to be YouTube videos or SMS advisories from suppliers.
As shown in Table 6, the observed absence of app usage, coupled with intermittent connectivity and mixed digital literacy, has direct implications for the design and deployment of any digital tool. The rice expert’s assessment was congruent with these findings, noting that while farmers value practical, stage-based guidance, adoption is hindered by connectivity and usability barriers. Published accounts from Davao del Sur similarly document digital literacy and connectivity gaps as persistent obstacles to agricultural app usage, with awareness of select applications not translating into routine use (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022).
The cross-case regularities establish the operational realities into which any mobile decision-support tool must fit. Farmers are consistently transplanting at similar seedling ages, relying on multi-stage nutrient programs anchored by complete fertilizer and urea, and deploying molluscicides and herbicides according to predictable windows and contingencies. At the same time, they contend with water-driven shocks at transplanting, stem borer dynamics that make late insecticide sprays ineffective, rat damage that requires localized baiting, and input subsidy shortfalls that create persistent mismatches between recommended and feasible quantities. 
Decision rules are implicitly formed by intuitive processing based on crop appearance, synchronized planting schedules, and intermittent extension advice. As confirmed by the local rice expert and cited in published sources for the province, these patterns are representative of the municipality’s irrigated lowland systems and provide a robust empirical basis for subsequent design (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022; Palinkas et al., 2015). 
Taken together, the results indicate that an effective digital intervention should reflect existing seasonal patterns, formalize complex steps that are currently estimated, and deliver timing cues that map directly onto irrigation and pest windows without depending on continuous connectivity.
The patterns reported above justify the development of an offline, contextually grounded mobile application tailored to Hagonoy’s rice-farming conditions. Reliance on experience and rough estimation predominates alongside minimal adoption of farm-specific apps. As summarized in Table 7, fertilization is multi-stage and product-specific, creating recurring needs for quantity calculation and timing reminders. Table 8 further shows that water events and pest dynamics are highly time-sensitive, with preventive windows where interventions are most effective. A tool that encodes prevailing local practice into structured, stage-based plans, supports on-device yield estimation with transparent explanations, and provides guidance on seed rates and fertilizer applications tailored to hybrid and inbred systems would directly respond to the situations identified in interviews. Providing farmers with clearer guidance for estimating inputs and timing interventions could support more systematic, “smarter” farming practices. Because connectivity is intermittent and device capacity is limited, the application must be offline-first, multilingual, and optimized for low-spec Android devices. This need is validated empirically by farmer accounts, substantiated by the local rice expert’s agreement, and reinforced by published work on technology adoption barriers and stage-based agronomic guidance applicable to the study area (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). 
The qualitative findings established thematic patterns across eleven farmer interviews, revealing consistent practices in transplanting methods, multi-stage fertilization, pest management priorities, and technology adoption barriers. To quantify the prevalence of these patterns and to measure the variability in key agronomic inputs across a larger sample, Phase 1 proceeded to a structured quantitative survey. The survey aimed to establish distributional characteristics for critical variables including land area, variety selection, seed rates, fertilizer application quantities by stage, and pest pressure indicators. Additionally, the quantitative phase sought to document the range of yield outcomes across farms, providing empirical bounds for model training and validation. The analytical mode shifted from thematic coding to descriptive statistics, with categorical variables summarized as counts and percentages, and continuous variables reported as medians with interquartile ranges to accommodate non-normal distributions typical of agricultural data.
Quantitative findings
Following the methodology outlined by Lavrakas (2011), surveys were administered through face-to-face interviews, yielding a total of 54 responses (complete raw dataset shown in Appendix Table 2 to Appendix Table 5) from farmers within the locality. Building on qualitative insights and preliminary investigations identified in related literature, key agronomical factors were selected to facilitate the generation of quantitative findings, which aimed to further validate local agricultural practices and qualitative observations specific to Hagonoy, Davao del Sur.
The dataset comprised 54 farm records with complete information across all input features and the target yield variable. Table 9 presents comprehensive descriptive statistics for all measured variables, organized by activity stage in the rice production process. Findings demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in both input practices and yield outcomes, validating patterns observed during qualitative interviews and establishing the empirical foundation for predictive modeling. The following subsections interpret key patterns and implications from these quantitative findings.
Sample and crop establishment practices. Respondents managed a median of 1.00 ha of rice land (Table 9), with an interquartile range of 0.75 to 2.00 ha, indicating a predominantly smallholder farming context. Transplanting was universal in the sample (100%). Hybrid varieties predominated, with 83% of farmers reporting hybrid use compared to 17% reporting inbred varieties. Seed quantity showed substantial variation, with a median of 18 kg and interquartile range of 15 to 30 kg.
The observed seed rate range of 15 to 30 kilograms, representing a roughly two-fold variation, suggests that seed rate optimization guidance could provide substantial value to farmers. Those at the upper quartile may be over-seeding relative to recommended densities for their variety type, incurring unnecessary costs without proportional yield gains, while farmers at the lower quartile may risk suboptimal plant populations. The strong hybrid preference (83.3%) aligns with yield maximization objectives documented in interviews, yet the persistent use of inbred varieties by 16.7% of respondents confirms that economic accessibility and seed availability constraints continue to influence variety decisions despite known performance differentials (Mariano et al., 2012). The predominantly smallholder landholding pattern (median 1.00 ha; IQR 0.75-2.00 ha) reinforces the importance of input optimization and yield risk management for household food security and income stability.
Fertilizer schedules and products. Reported fertilization schedules matched the qualitative three-stage pattern documented in interviews (Table 7). Product usage patterns (Table 9) showed that Complete fertilizer (14-14-14) dominated the first application (median: 100 kg), often combined with Urea (median: 50 kg). The second application predominantly featured Urea (median: 100 kg) and Complete fertilizer (median: 100 kg), with Ammonium Sulfate used by a subset of farmers. Muriate of Potash (0-0-60) appeared primarily in third applications for late-stage supplementation, though many farms applied no third fertilizer dose. 
The wide variation in fertilizer quantities and timing (Table 9) reflected the experience-based, intuition-guided decision-making documented in qualitative interviews (Table 7, Theme I9). The strong agreement between qualitative and quantitative phases justifies stage-based feature engineering of nutrient inputs and supports using standardized nutrient-equivalent units to harmonize different product mixes (DA-ATI CAR, 2022).
Pests, weeds, and protection inputs. Pest incidence was widespread (Table 9), with stem borer (89% of farms) and golden apple snail/kuhol (63%) being the most prevalent challenges. In contrast, rats (13%), cutworms (6%), and rice blast disease (19%) were less commonly reported.

IQR = Interquartile Range (25th–75th percentile).
Protection input patterns (Table 9) showed that molluscicide use was concentrated among farms reporting kuhol presence (median: 0 sachets across the full sample, but applied by 63% of farms reporting kuhol). Insecticide volumes were comparatively low (median: 0 L, maximum: 3 L), reflecting the limited routine application documented in qualitative findings (Table 7, Theme I4). Herbicide application was more widespread (median: 0.5 L), targeting weed pressure during the establishment phase.
Weed and golden apple snail control clustered around establishment windows, while insecticide volumes were oriented to preventive timing for stem borer. Rat bait was used selectively where damage was evident. This concentration of protection activities in
 
narrow windows reinforces the need for stage-timed prompts and explains yield sensitivity to early water events that can trigger snail outbreaks and rework.
Water, irrigation, and weather. All respondents reported access to NIA irrigation (Table 9), reflecting the study's focus on irrigated lowland systems. Despite irrigation infrastructure, weather-related challenges during the season were reported by 80% of farmers, including flooding near transplanting and dry season pumping costs documented in qualitative interviews (Table 7, Themes I7-I8). 
These contextual factors influence input timing, costs, and risk. The presence of weather shocks without detailed environmental covariates (such as rainfall amount, temperature, or wind speed, which were excluded due to data availability constraints) indicates an upper bound on explainable variance for predictive models that focus on farmer-controllable inputs, which is consistent with the study objective to deliver actionable, offline decision support.
Yields and productivity variability. Farm-level palay yield (Table 9) showed a median of 6,287 kilograms, with values ranging from 1,220 kilograms (lowest performing farm) to 20,790 kilograms (highest performing farm), indicating substantial variability in productivity across the sample (Appendix Table 2 to Appendix Table 5). This seventeen-fold difference between minimum and maximum yields far exceeded normal agronomic variation attributable to variety selection alone, suggesting that management practices, input quality, timing precision, pest pressure, and weather events exerted substantial influence on outcomes.
Analysis of variety performance within the sample revealed that hybrid farms (n=45) exhibited yields ranging from 1,220 to 20,790 kg, while inbred farms (n=9) ranged from 3,250 to 13,020 kg. Despite hybrids' higher maximum potential (evidenced by the 20,790 kg top-performing farm), median yields were comparable (6,174 kg for hybrids vs. 6,615 kg for inbreds). Both variety types demonstrated substantial within-group heterogeneity, with hybrids showing a seventeen-fold internal range compared to a four-fold range for inbreds.
This pattern indicated that variety choice alone was insufficient to predict individual farm outcomes. The extreme overall yield variation suggested that management practices (fertilizer timing, pest control effectiveness, land preparation quality), input quality and quantity (variable fertilizer rates and products shown in Table 9), timing precision (alignment of operations with crop development stages), pest pressure (89% stem borer incidence, 63% kuhol incidence), and weather events (80% reporting weather challenges) exerted substantial combined influence on outcomes, dominating any variety effects.
This documented yield variability established a compelling justification for the GabayPalay prediction tool. High variance in outcomes, even among farmers operating in the same municipality with ostensibly similar agro-climatic conditions, indicated substantial uncertainty in production planning. A decision-support system capable of integrating multiple input variables to estimate expected yield under specific management scenarios could help farmers evaluate input trade-offs, anticipate outcomes, and make more informed decisions regarding resource allocation. The wide yield distribution, with a seventeen-fold range between minimum and maximum values, also defined the prediction challenge for the Random Forest model. The system must capture sufficient complexity to explain meaningful variation while avoiding overfitting to outlier observations at the distribution tails. The ensemble learning approach, with its capacity to model non-linear interactions among predictors, was well-suited to this environment where yield outcomes reflected complex combinations of variety choice, nutrient management, pest control, weather exposure, and operational timing rather than simple additive effects of individual inputs.
Derived system requirements
Building on the convergent evidence from qualitative interviews (n=11) and quantitative surveys (n=54), functional and non-functional requirements were systematically derived to address documented farmer needs, operational constraints, and technology adoption barriers. This section presents the requirements specification that guided subsequent design and implementation phases.
Functional requirements. Six functional requirements (FR1-FR6) define the core capabilities that the GabayPalay application must deliver to support rice farmers' decision-making processes. Each requirement directly addresses empirical patterns documented in the qualitative and quantitative findings. Table 10 presents the complete functional requirements specification with traceability to empirical sources.
Table 10. Functional requirements derived from farming practices analysis.
ID	Requirement Description	Key Empirical Evidence
FR1	Offline Yield Prediction Capability. Complete prediction functionality without internet dependency.	100% non-usage of agri apps (Table 6, Theme I12, n=11); 80% weather-related challenges (Table 9); Connectivity constraints in rural barangays.
FR2	Stage-Based Input Management. Three-phase fertilizer input (basal, early top-dress, late top-dress) with automatic NPK standardization.	100% multi-stage fertilization practice (Table 6, Theme I9); Typical timing 3-10, 15-30, 45-60 DAT (Table 7); Five common fertilizer products requiring standardization.

Table 10. (cont.).
FR3	Variety Classification and Seed Rate Management. Binary variety selection (Hybrid/Inbred) with seed rate validation (15-40 kg/ha).	Hybrid preference with cost constraints (Table 6, Theme I10: 7/11); 83% hybrid adoption, seed median 18 kg, IQR 15-30 kg (Table 9).

FR4	Pest and Disease Recording. Binary presence indicators for 5 key categories (stem borer, rats, kuhol, cutworms, rice blast) plus protection product quantities.	IPM orientation (Table 6, Theme I4: 10/11 limited insecticide); Prevalence: stem borer 89%, kuhol 63%, rats 13% (Table 9).

FR5	Transparent Prediction Presentation. Yield display in kg with conversions to cavans/sacks, confidence indicators, and feature importance visualization.	Trust concerns on app accuracy (Table 6, Theme I12); Zero baseline agri-app usage requiring interpretability support.
FR6	Historical Record Management. Local persistence of predictions (timestamp, inputs, yields) with favorites for scenario comparison.	Experience-based decisions (3-40+ years farming experience); Multiple plot management; Season-to-season comparison needs.

FR1 (Offline Yield Prediction Capability) addresses the universal non-usage of agricultural applications (Table 6, Theme I12: 100% across 11 interviews) and connectivity constraints documented in 80% of survey respondents (Table 9). The requirement mandates complete functionality without internet dependency, implemented by embedding the Random Forest model directly in the application package with local database storage for all farm data and historical predictions. This offline architecture aligns with FAO (2017) documentation of rural connectivity barriers as a critical constraint to agricultural technology adoption in Philippine contexts.
FR2 (Stage-Based Agricultural Input Management) operationalizes the universal multi-stage fertilization pattern (Table 6, Theme I9: 100% reported 2-3 applications). The requirement organizes data entry according to the basal/top-dress sequence documented in qualitative interviews (Table 7: typical timing 3-10 DAT, 15-30 DAT, 45-60 DAT) and survey responses, with automatic NPK standardization via Equations [7] to [9] to harmonize the five common fertilizer products identified (Urea 46-0-0, Ammonium Sulfate 21-0-0, Ammonium Phosphate 16-20-0, Complete 14-14-14, Potash 0-0-60). This stage-based approach is consistent with DA-ATI CAR (2022) recommendations for nutrient management in irrigated lowland rice systems and PhilRice guidelines on fertilizer timing optimization.
FR3 (Rice Variety Classification and Seed Rate Management) reflects the observed hybrid preference (83% in surveys, Table 9) constrained by economic accessibility (Table 6, Theme I10: 7/11 cited cost/availability barriers). Binary variety classification (Hybrid=1, Inbred=0) and seed rate validation ranges (15-40 kg/ha based on observed IQR 15-30 kg) match documented practices while preventing unrealistic inputs. The economic constraint pattern aligns with Mariano et al. (2012) findings on variety adoption economics in Philippine rice farming, where yield potential awareness does not guarantee hybrid adoption without addressing cost and availability barriers.
FR4 (Pest, Disease, and Water Management Recording) captures the five key challenges identified through thematic analysis with quantitative validation: stem borer (89% prevalence), golden apple snail/kuhol (63%), rats (13%), cutworms (6%), and rice blast (19%, Table 9). Binary presence indicators reflect the preventive IPM orientation documented in Table 6, Theme I4 (10/11 reported limited routine insecticide use), where farmers described pest management in present/absent terms rather than quantitative severity scales. This approach is consistent with Bureau of Agriculture and Fisheries Standards (2019) integrated pest management (IPM) protocols for irrigated lowland rice, which emphasize preventive timing and early detection over severity-based intervention thresholds.
FR5 (Transparent Prediction Result Presentation) addresses trust concerns and interpretation challenges identified during requirements planning (Table 6, Theme I12). Display of yield predictions in kilograms with conversions to local units, and feature importance visualization derived from Random Forest internal metrics supports farmer understanding and adoption among users with zero baseline agricultural app experience. This transparency approach follows the model interpretability strategy documented in David (2023) for agricultural machine learning applications, where visual feature importance displays facilitated farmer comprehension of yield predictions.
FR6 (Historical Prediction Record Management) enables the longitudinal, experience-based decision-making documented across interviews (farming experience range 3-40+ years). Local persistence of complete prediction records (timestamps, all input parameters, predicted yields, user-assigned favorites) supports season-to-season comparison, trend analysis, and scenario evaluation without requiring external data transmission or cloud storage. This design aligns with Davis (1989) Technology Acceptance Model findings that perceived usefulness enhanced through historical comparison capabilities positively influences continued system use and long-term adoption.
Non-functional requirements. Five non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR5) specify quality attributes, performance constraints, and operational characteristics necessary for effective deployment within documented constraints. Table 11 presents the non-functional requirements with specifications and validation criteria.
NFR1 (Device Compatibility and Resource Optimization) accommodates the low-specification devices observed during field surveys (2GB RAM minimum among farmer smartphones) through strict resource constraints: APK size ≤50 MB enabling Bluetooth transfer distribution (addressing connectivity limitations documented in Table 6), and RAM usage ≤150 MB during active use ensuring graceful performance on entry-level Android devices. The Android 8.0 minimum (API level 26) balances device compatibility (covering estimated 85%+ of farmer smartphones based on informal observation during surveys) with access to modern development features. This resource optimization approach follows Android Developers (2025) best practices for backward compatibility and performance on resource-constrained devices in developing country contexts.
Table 11. Non-functional requirements and operational specifications.
ID	Requirement Description	Target Specification	Key Rationale
NFR1	Device Compatibility and Resource Optimization. Android ≥8.0 with resource constraints for low-spec devices.	API ≥26; APK ≤50 MB; RAM ≤150 MB active use	2GB RAM minimum observed during surveys; Bluetooth distribution requirement; Computational constraints.
NFR2	Usability and Accessibility. Simplified UI for low digital literacy with SUS ≥70 target.	Simplified interaction; Clear hierarchy; Intuitive navigation; SUS ≥ 70 (Brooke, 1996)	100% no prior agri-app use (Table 6, Theme I12); Digital literacy gaps across age ranges.
NFR3	Prediction Performance. Response time ≤3 sec with ≥99% parity to Python baseline.	Execution ≤ 3 sec; Parity ≥ 99% (absolute difference <1 kg)	User engagement expectations; m2cgen conversion validation.
NFR4	Data Security and Privacy. Local-only storage with encryption, zero external transmission.	SQLite encryption; No network permissions; Complete data isolation	Privacy concerns (Appendix 1: Informed consent); Trust barriers on data sharing.
NFR5	System Reliability. Consistent predictions across devices with graceful error handling.	Zero crashes; Graceful degradation; Informative error messages	Field constraints (Table 8: flooding, power loss); Variable device quality and Android versions.
NFR2 (Usability and Accessibility) targets the documented digital literacy gaps (100% no prior agricultural app use, Table 6, Theme I12) through simplified interaction patterns, clear visual hierarchy, and intuitive navigation validated against System Usability Scale (SUS) target ≥70 for acceptable usability (Brooke, 1996). The requirement addresses the adoption constraint that awareness does not translate to sustained use without appropriate interface design for first-time users across diverse age ranges and educational backgrounds (elementary to college level). The SUS ≥70 threshold represents the established acceptability benchmark across diverse application domains, indicating that users can accomplish their goals with reasonable efficiency and satisfaction.
NFR3 (Prediction Performance and Response Time) mandates completion within 3 seconds to maintain user engagement and provide responsive feedback during the input workflow, based on informal timing expectations documented during pilot testing. The ≥99% numerical parity requirement ensures faithful conversion of the Python scikit-learn Random Forest model to Java via m2cgen, with validation target of absolute difference <1 kg across all test samples to confirm preservation of model structure without rounding errors or implementation bugs. This validation approach follows model export protocols documented in James et al. (2023b), ensuring that converted models maintain prediction fidelity across computational environments.
NFR4 (Data Security and Privacy Protection) implements local-only storage with SQLite encryption and zero external data transmission, addressing privacy concerns documented in informed consent discussions (Appendix 1) and interview feedback expressing reluctance about data sharing with external parties. The application manifest excludes network permissions entirely, ensuring complete data isolation and addressing the trust barriers documented in the adoption constraint analysis. This privacy-preserving architecture ensures compliance with Data Privacy Act. (Republic Act No. 10173 | GOVPH, 2012), which mandates protection of personal information and requires informed consent for data collection, storage, and transmission in Philippine contexts.
NFR5 (System Reliability and Error Resilience) ensures consistent predictions across device configurations (manufacturer variations, screen sizes, Android versions within API 26+ range) through comprehensive input validation at each stage, graceful error handling for incomplete or invalid inputs with informative non-technical error messages, and recovery mechanisms preventing data loss from unexpected states. The requirement addresses field constraints documented in qualitative findings (Table 8: flooding, power loss scenarios affecting device operation) and variable technological familiarity requiring robust system stability to build user trust among first-time agricultural app users. This defensive programming approach aligns with Android Developers (2025) recommendations for production applications and software reliability principles.
Requirements traceability and constraints. The systematic derivation of functional and non-functional requirements from empirical observations established complete traceability between farmer needs, documented practices, and technical specifications. Each requirement can be traced to specific qualitative themes (Table 6), quantitative findings (Table 9), and supporting literature, ensuring that all system capabilities directly address documented farmer needs rather than assumed features.
This traceability framework enabled verification that all identified farmer needs received corresponding system capabilities, while excluding capabilities lacking empirical justification. For example, real-time weather API integration was excluded despite potential predictive value because farmers prioritized offline functionality (FR1) over additional features requiring connectivity. Similarly, severity-based pest scoring was excluded in favor of binary presence indicators (FR4) because farmers consistently described pest management in present/absent terms during interviews rather than using quantitative severity scales.
Three primary constraint categories shaped requirements derivation and design decisions:
	Data Availability Constraint. Weather variables including rainfall amount, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, despite documented significance in related yield prediction literature (Dait, 2023; David, 2023; Stuecker et al., 2018), were excluded from the feature set due to limited local automated weather station infrastructure and farmer access to formal meteorological data in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. The binary weather challenge indicator provides farmer-perceived impact (Table 9: 80% reported weather challenges) without requiring quantitative measurements unavailable to target users, establishing a model focused on farmer-controllable inputs rather than environmental factors beyond farmer influence.
	Computational Constraint. Mobile device processing limitations (2GB RAM minimum observed during surveys) and offline distribution requirements (for instance, Bluetooth transfer via APK files) necessitated restricting model complexity to configurations compatible with resource-constrained devices. This constraint influenced selection of model architecture, hyperparameter search space boundaries, and model export strategies to ensure deployment feasibility on farmer-owned smartphones without requiring server connectivity or high-specification hardware.
	Adoption Constraint. Zero baseline usage of farm-specific agricultural applications among all interview participants (Table 6, Theme I12: 100%, n=11) necessitated prioritizing simplified interfaces (NFR2), offline functionality (FR1), and local data control (NFR4) over advanced features that might increase complexity or require technological familiarity. The constraint analysis conducted through consultation with the municipal agriculture office and rice specialist indicated that awareness of agricultural apps does not translate to sustained use without addressing digital literacy gaps, trust barriers regarding data sharing, and connectivity limitations specific to the deployment context.
The requirements were validated through consultation with the Hagonoy-based rice specialist who participated in qualitative theme validation, confirming that specified capabilities aligned with practical farming workflows, local pest management challenges, and extension recommendations while remaining technically feasible within documented constraints. The Municipal Agriculture Office of Hagonoy, Davao del Sur facilitated farmer participant recruitment and confirmed that the documented farming practices (transplanting methods, fertilization patterns, pest pressures) aligned with patterns observed in local extension activities and agricultural development programs. The derived requirements specification, validated constraints, and established traceability framework provided the foundation for subsequent model development, system design, and implementation phases.
Feature set identification
The systematic analysis of farming practices documented in qualitative and quantitative findings informed the identification of 27 input variables necessary for yield prediction modeling.

The feature set encompassed eight pre-planting variables (X_1-X_8) related to land preparation, establishment decisions, and irrigation access; nine nutrient management variables (X_9-X_17) capturing fertilization practices; nine pest and disease variables (X_18-X_26) documenting challenges and management responses; and one environmental variable (X_27) accounting for weather-related challenges during the season.
This format directly reflected the activity-based categorization framework documented in the qualitative and quantitative findings. Pre-planting features (X_1-X_8) operationalized the universal transplanting practice (100% of farmers, Table 6, Theme I1), variety preferences (83% hybrid, Table 9), seed rate variation (median 18 kg, IQR 15-30 kg, Table 9), land preparation methods (98% tractor use, 65% rotavator, Table 9), and irrigation availability (100% NIA access, Table 9) identified during Phase 1 investigations.
Nutrient management features (X_9-X_17) operationalized the multi-stage fertilization patterns documented in 100% farmer interviews (Table 6, Theme I9) and quantitative surveys (Table 7, Table 9). Rather than recording raw fertilizer product quantities (which varied across five common formulations: Urea 46-0-0, Ammonium Sulfate 21-0-0, Ammonium Phosphate 16-20-0, Complete 14-14-14, Potash 0-0-60 documented in Table 7), features X_9-X_17 represent standardized NPK nutrient content computed as detailed in Equations [7]-[9]. This standardization addressed the wide variation in fertilizer products and timing documented in Table 9 while enabling model training on nutrient-equivalent units aligned with agronomic principles (DA-ATI CAR, 2022).
Pest and disease features (X_18-X_22) captured the five key challenges identified through thematic analysis: stem borer (89% prevalence, Table 9), golden apple snail/kuhol (63%), rats (13%), cutworms (6%), and rice blast (19%). These binary presence indicators reflected the preventive IPM orientation documented in qualitative findings (Table 6, Theme I4: 10/11 reported limited routine insecticide use) rather than severity gradations, as farmers consistently described pest management in present/absent rather than quantitative severity terms. 
Pest management input features (X_23-X_26) quantified protection product usage: insecticide (median 0 L), herbicide (median 0.5 L), rat poison (median 0 g), and molluscicide (median 0 sachets), aligning with the concentrated application windows around establishment documented in both qualitative interviews and quantitative patterns (Table 9).
The environmental challenge variable (X_27) operationalized the weather-related constraints reported by 80% of farmers (Table 9), including flooding near transplanting and dry-season water stress documented in qualitative accounts (Table 6, Themes I7-I8). While detailed meteorological covariates (rainfall amount, temperature, wind speed) were excluded due to data availability constraints identified in the constraint analysis discussed in the previous section, the binary weather challenge indicator captured farmer-perceived weather impacts on the growing season.
The complete 27-feature specification established the input variable framework for subsequent model development, with each feature directly traceable to empirical observations from farmer interviews and surveys. This traceability ensured that the predictive model would accept inputs aligned with actual farming practices and decision-making contexts documented during requirements planning, supporting the development of a decision-support tool grounded in local agricultural realities rather than theoretical or externally-imposed variable selections.
Model Development and Hyperparameter Optimization
Following the feature set specification derived from Phase 1, the model development phase focused on training, optimizing, and validating a Random Forest Regressor for palay yield prediction using the 27 input features (X_1-X_27) and the target variable Y (palay yield in kilograms). This section presents the hyperparameter search process, the optimal model configuration, and performance evaluation on the held-out test set.
Hyperparameter search and optimal configuration
The hyperparameter optimization process evaluated 216 Random Forest configurations through 3-fold cross-validation on the training set (presented in Table 5). A total of 54 farms were included in the analysis, yielding 37 training samples (70%) and 17 test samples (30%) following the 70-30 split procedure detailed in the methodology. Table 13 presents the optimal hyperparameter configuration that achieved the highest cross-validation performance among all evaluated combinations. 
The optimal configuration balanced model complexity (200 trees with maximum depth 10) against overfitting risk (controlled through max_depth constraint and feature subsampling via max_features=‘sqrt’). The max_depth=10 constraint prevented individual trees from growing excessively deep and memorizing training data, while the ‘sqrt’ feature selection ensured each split considered approximately 5 randomly selected features from the full set of 27, promoting diversity among the 200 trees in the ensemble (James et al., 2023b). The grid search identified this configuration as achieving the highest mean cross-validation R^2 of 0.6040 ± 0.1043 across the three folds, indicating consistent performance across different training/validation splits within the 70% training set. Complete evaluation results for all hyperparameter combinations are provided in Appendix Table 6 for transparency and reproducibility.
Table 13. Optimal Random Forest hyperparameters identified through grid search.
Hyperparameter	Selected Value	Interpretation
n_estimators	200	200 decision trees in the ensemble
max_depth	10	Maximum tree depth of 10 levels
min_samples_split	2	Minimum 2 samples required to split a node
min_samples_leaf	1	Minimum 1 sample required at a leaf node 
max_features	'sqrt'	√27  ≈ 5 features considered at each split 
Test set performance
The optimized Random Forest model, trained on 37 farms, was evaluated on a held-out test set of 17 farms (30% of the dataset) that were not used during training or hyperparameter optimization. Table 14 presents the performance metrics on this independent test set.
The test set R^2 of 0.765 indicates that the model explains approximately 76.5% of yield variance in previously unseen farms. The unexplained 23.5% likely reflects unmeasured variables excluded during Phase 1 due to data availability constraints, including quantitative weather data (rainfall amounts, temperature extremes), soil quality differences, and management execution quality. This performance aligns with related agricultural studies using ensemble methods on small datasets (David, 2023: R^2=0.78; Jiya et al., 2023: R^2=0.72).
The RMSE of 2,286 kg corresponds to approximately 36% of the median yield (6,287 kg, Table 9), reflecting the substantial variability documented in Phase 1 (yield range 1,220-20,790 kg driven by farm size heterogeneity, seed quality variation, fertilizer rate differences, and weather challenges affecting 80% of farmers). The MAE of 1,731 kg, being lower than RMSE, indicates that while typical errors are moderate, occasional larger errors occur at the distribution's extremes. 
Table 14. Performance metrics of the optimized Random Forest model on the hold-out test set (n=17 farms).
Metric	Value
R^2 (coefficient of determination)	0.765
RMSE (root mean squared error)	2,286 kg
MAE (mean absolute error)	1,731 kg
MSE (mean squared error)	5,225,856 kg²

 
Fig. 20. Predicted versus actual yield for training (blue) and test (orange) sets. The dashed line represents perfect 1:1 agreement. Test samples maintain reasonable alignment despite not being used during training, demonstrating generalization.
To visualize the model's prediction behavior across the full yield range, Fig. 20 presents the relationship between predicted and actual yields for both training and test sets.
Points cluster more tightly in the mid-yield range (5,000-13,000 kg) where Phase 1 observations concentrated (median 6,287 kg, IQR 4,410-10,434 kg), with greater dispersion at extremes reflecting sparse training data (<4,000 kg and >15,000 kg). Test samples distribute along the diagonal similarly to training samples, confirming generalization rather than memorization. While Fig. 20 shows overall prediction alignment with actual yields, residual analysis provides deeper insight into error patterns and potential systematic bias. Fig. 21 presents residuals (actual minus predicted yield) for both datasets.
Residuals scatter randomly around zero without systematic patterns (funnel shapes, curves), with most within ±3,000 kg. This validates suggesting that the 27 features derived from Phase 1 explorations (activity-based organization: pre-planting, nutrient management, pest management, environmental challenges) captured many of the key yield drivers. The balanced distribution above and below zero confirms absence of systematic over- or under-prediction.
Outlier residuals (>±4,000 "kg" ) correspond to extreme yields (Table 9: minimum 1,220 kg, maximum 20,790 kg). For example, the test sample with the largest negative residual (-6,700 kg) had actual yield 20,790 kg (the maximum), which the model conservatively predicted at ~14,000 kg due to sparse training examples above 15,000 kg.
The validated Random Forest model (200 trees, max_depth=10, sqrt feature selection) achieving R^2=0.765 on the test set established the prediction performance baseline for the Python scikit-learn implementation. To enable offline yield prediction on Android devices (FR1), the model required conversion from Python to Java code via m2cgen. The following section presents the model export process and numerical parity validation to ensure the Java implementation preserved prediction accuracy.
 
Fig. 21. Residual plot for training (blue) and test (orange) sets. Vertical lines show error magnitudes relative to zero. Random scatter indicates no systematic bias.
Model export and parity validation
Following validation of the Random Forest model's predictive performance on the held-out test set, the model was exported from Python scikit-learn to Java code using m2cgen (Model to Code Generator, version 0.10.0) to enable offline prediction on Android devices without requiring internet connectivity (FR1) or server infrastructure.
The m2cgen library transpiled the trained Random Forest Regressor (200 trees, 27 input features, max_depth=10) into a standalone Java class containing a score(double[] features) method that implements the complete decision logic of all 200 trees without external dependencies. The exported code consists of nested if-else statements representing the decision tree structure, with feature thresholds and leaf values hardcoded from the trained model, enabling deterministic predictions identical to the original Python implementation.
To ensure conversion fidelity, numerical parity validation compared predictions between the original Python scikit-learn model and the exported Java implementation across all test set samples (n=17). The parity testing methodology, detailed in Appendix 8, involved extracting the 27 feature values for each test sample, executing both Python and Java predictions, and computing absolute differences and relative errors. A tolerance threshold of 0.01% was established as the acceptance criterion, consistent with industry standards for model deployment validation. 
Table 15 presents the parity validation results summarizing the comparison across all 17 test samples. For this test set, numerical parity was achieved, with observed absolute differences of 0.00 kg and relative errors of 0.0000% for every prediction (to the recorded precision). These results indicate that, for the evaluated samples, the Java implementation replicated the Python model’s outputs exactly, with no detectable rounding errors or implementation discrepancies within the chosen precision. The zero-difference outcome is well within the 0.01% tolerance threshold, supporting the conclusion that m2cgen’s code generation preserved the trained tree structure, feature thresholds, and leaf values for this model configuration.
This validation addressed the computational constraint, where m2cgen code generation file size limits necessitated restricting the model to ≤200 trees and max_depth ≤10. The successful parity validation confirmed that these constraints did not compromise prediction accuracy during conversion, and that the selected configuration (200 trees, depth 10) remained within m2cgen's operational limits while preserving the test set performance metrics documented in Table 14.
The validated Java model established the foundation for integration into the Android application architecture, where it operates completely offline without external libraries or network connectivity. The model receives farmer-provided feature values and generates yield predictions directly on the mobile device, eliminating the need for server infrastructure and enabling real-time decision support in areas with limited internet access.

Mobile Application Development
Following the derivation of functional and non-functional requirements from empirical farmer observations (Table 10-Table 11) and the validation of the Random Forest prediction model with numerical parity between the Python and Java implementations (Table 15), the construction phase translated these specifications into a working Android mobile application. The GabayPalay application was developed using Android Studio with Kotlin as the primary programming language, integrating the m2cgen-generated Java model directly into the application package to enable complete offline operation without internet dependency (FR1, NFR1). Development followed the Rapid Application Development construction phase methodology, with iterative functional testing culminating in deployment for user acceptance evaluation.
This section presents the system architecture and model integration, data flow and application workflow, functional requirements implementation with user interface evidence, non-functional requirements validation, and deployment procedures.
System architecture and model integration
The GabayPalay mobile application was implemented using a three-layer modular architecture (in Fig. 22) that separated user interface concerns from business logic and data management. This architectural approach enabled independent development and testing of each layer while supporting the offline operation requirement (NFR1) and facilitating validation of model accuracy independently from user interface usability.
The Data and Model Layer (Fig. 22, bottom section) contained the m2cgen-generated Model.java class implementing the Random Forest prediction algorithm (200 trees, max_depth=10, validated in Table 15) with a standalone score() method that accepts the 27-element feature vector and returns predicted yield in kilograms. The Java model file accounted for approximately 71% of the codebase by language composition, with application logic comprising 28.9% in Kotlin. The Android manifest declared no network permissions, ensuring complete offline operation as specified in FR1. Local data persistence was implemented using Android Room Persistence Library, a modern abstraction layer over SQLite that provided compile-time verification of SQL queries and simplified database operations.
 
Fig. 22. Three-layer modular architecture of the GabayPalay mobile application showing separation between User Interface Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data and Model Layer with specific implementation classes, adapted from Gillis (2024).
The AppDatabase class extended RoomDatabase and defined two Data Access Object (DAO) interfaces: PredictionHistoryDao for managing prediction summary records in the prediction_history table and PredictionInputDao for managing complete farm input records in the prediction_inputs table. The HistoryManager singleton class wrapped these DAO operations, providing simplified methods (savePrediction(), getAllHistory(), setFavorite(), deletePrediction()) that the UI layer activities could invoke. Entity classes (PredictionHistoryEntity, PredictionInputEntity) defined the database table schemas with Room annotations, while corresponding domain model classes (PredictionHistory, PredictionInputs, PredictionResult, FertilizerApplication) represented the data structures used by business logic and UI layers. Type converters handled serialization of complex types (Date objects, List<String>) for database storage. This implementation enabled historical tracking (FR6) while maintaining all data on-device to address the privacy requirement (NFR4) and the connectivity constraints documented during requirements planning.
The Business Logic Layer (Fig. 22, middle section) was implemented primarily through the PredictionManager singleton object, the InputMapper utility class, and the FertilizerUtils utility class. The PredictionManager handled input validation, feature vector construction from user-provided data (X_1-X_27), model invocation via calculateYield(), and result interpretation through sensitivity analysis. The FertilizerUtils class provided automatic NPK nutrient calculation methods that computed total nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium quantities from fertilizer formulations and application amounts. Input validation verified that required fields contained valid positive numeric values to prevent erroneous entries while maintaining flexibility for the documented variability in farmer practices. The PredictionManager maintained application state across activity transitions using in-memory storage, enabling the staged input workflow (FR2) without requiring persistent storage until prediction completion. The InputMapper class provided utility methods for mapping data between Android Intent objects and the PredictionInputs data class during activity transitions. The automatic NPK calculation reduced the cognitive burden of manual nutrient computation for farmers unfamiliar with fertilizer chemistry, addressing the complexity identified during requirements planning.
The User Interface Layer (Fig. 22, top section) comprised nine primary Kotlin Activity classes implemented with Material Design 3 components and XML layouts: (1) MainActivity providing the application entry point and primary navigation, (2) PredictPalayActivity managing the optional onboarding flow for first-time users with a "Don't show again" preference, (3) PrePlantingActivity collecting land area, rice variety, seed amount, planting method, and land preparation inputs, (4) NutrientManagementActivity handling multi-application fertilizer tracking with automatic unit conversion between kilograms and sacks, (5) PestManagementActivity capturing pest identification and pesticide application data, (6) WeatherManagementActivity collecting the binary weather challenge indicator, (7) PreviewActivity displaying the comprehensive input review modal before prediction execution, (8) OutputActivity presenting prediction results with yield estimates, unit conversions, feature importance visualizations, insights, and recommendations, and (9) HistoryActivity managing the display and filtering of saved prediction records with favorites support. 
These activities organized the input workflow into dedicated screens corresponding to rice production stages identified during Phase 1 interviews. The UI maintained compatibility with Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above to accommodate the range of smartphone devices documented during Phase 1 farmer surveys, with target specifications set to ensure broad accessibility across device types available in the study area. The final APK size of 12.4 MB remained 75% below the 50 MB target specified in NFR1, enabling distribution via Bluetooth and social media messaging platforms to accommodate the connectivity constraints documented in Phase 1.
The implemented architecture supported the data flow shown in Fig. 22, where farmers provide farm inputs through the mobile interface (UI Layer activities), the PredictionManager validates and processes inputs locally (Business Logic Layer), the Model.java class generates predictions (Data and Model Layer), and the HistoryManager stores results via Room DAOs in the local SQLite database for historical review. No external data transmission occurs at any stage, satisfying both the offline operation requirement (FR1) and the data privacy requirement (NFR4) while eliminating dependency on internet connectivity documented as unreliable during Phase 1 investigations.
Data and application workflow
The implemented system processes farmer inputs through modular workflows organized by rice production activities, as illustrated in the data flow diagrams and control 
flow diagrams. All data processing occurs locally on the mobile device without external transmission, satisfying the offline operation requirement (FR1) and privacy protection requirement (NFR4) while addressing the connectivity constraints documented during Phase 1.
System context. The system context diagram (in Fig. 23) illustrates the application's boundary and its interaction with the external environment. The Farmer provides farm input data (land characteristics, rice variety, fertilizer applications, pest management practices, weather conditions) to the GabayPalay system, which processes this information entirely on-device and returns yield predictions, insights, and agronomic recommendations. No external systems, databases, or network services are involved in the data flow, reflecting the offline-first architecture that eliminates dependencies on internet connectivity or cloud infrastructure. This closed-loop design ensures that all sensitive farm data remains under the farmer's control on their personal device.
Internal system workflow. The internal workflow in Fig. 24 organized data collection into four input modules corresponding to the farming activities identified during Phase 1 interviews: pre-planting preparation (Process 1.0), fertilizer management (Process 2.0), pest management (Process 3.0), and environmental challenges (Process 4.0). Each module captured specific input variables from the feature set before aggregating them for yield prediction (Process 5.0). The palay yield prediction module executed the embedded Random Forest model via the PredictionManager.calculateYield() method, which invoked the Java model's score() function with the 27-element feature vector, and generated results that were saved to Local Storage along with the corresponding farm inputs through the HistoryManager.savePrediction() method. 
 
Fig. 23. Data flow diagram (DFD Level 0) showing the GabayPalay system context with the Farmer as the sole external entity interacting with the application through farm input data and receiving yield predictions and recommendations.
The yield prediction history module (Process 6.0) retrieved stored records from the SQLite database via HistoryManager.getAllHistory(), enabling farmers to review past inputs and compare scenarios across seasons. This architecture supported the experience-based, seasonal decision-making pattern observed among all interviewed farmers.
The fertilizer management module in Fig. 25 implemented the three-stage fertilization pattern universal among interviewed farmers (Table 7, Theme I9: 100% reported 2–3 stage fertilization). Farmers first specified the number of application splits (Sub-process 2.1), typically 2 or 3 applications corresponding to basal, mid-season, and late-season timings documented in Phase 1. 
 
Fig. 24. Data flow diagram (DFD Level 1) showing the six major functional modules of the GabayPalay application and their interactions with the Farmer and Local Storage.
 
Fig. 25. Detailed data flow diagram (DFD Level 2) for the Fertilizer Management module, showing automatic NPK nutrient calculation based on fertilizer formulation selection.
For each split, farmers selected the fertilizer formulation and measurement unit (Sub-process 2.2), choosing from five standardized products identified during requirements planning: Complete 14-14-14, Urea 46-0-0, Ammosul 21-0-0, Muriate of Potash 0-0-60, and Complete 16-20-0. The system automatically calculated total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) quantities per application (Sub-process 2.3) through the FertilizerUtils class methods based on the NPK ratio of the selected fertilizer and the entered amount, storing these computed nutrient values as three separate features (total N, total P, total K per application split) that contributed to the 27-element feature vector. This automatic calculation reduced the cognitive burden of manual nutrient computation for farmers unfamiliar with fertilizer chemistry.
Application control flow. User navigation through the application followed the control flow illustrated in Fig. 27-Fig. 32. The main navigation structure in Fig. 26 provided two primary pathways from the home screen: initiating a new yield prediction or reviewing historical predictions, corresponding to the two core use cases identified during requirements planning (FR1 and FR6). Users selected their intended action through prominent buttons implemented in MainActivity, with an additional option to exit the application.
Prediction workflow. The prediction workflow guided users through sequential input stages organized by the rice production activities documented in Phase 1: pre-planting preparation, nutrient management, pest management, and weather conditions. At each stage, input validation prevented progression with incomplete data while allowing backward navigation for corrections via Android's back button handling. The PredictionManager singleton maintained application state across activity transitions using in-memory storage, with each activity writing its validated inputs to the manager via dedicated setter methods before proceeding to the next stage.
 
Fig. 26. Main navigation control flow showing entry points for the prediction workflow (Fig. 27-Fig. 31) and history workflow (Fig. 32).
 
Fig. 27. Control flow for the pre-planting input stage showing onboarding, data entry, validation, and navigation to the nutrient management stage (Connector 1→A).
The workflow began with the pre-planting stage (in Fig. 27), implemented through PrePlantingActivity, which collected fundamental farm characteristics: land area in hectares, rice variety selection, seed amount in kilograms, planting method, and land preparation methods. First-time users were presented with an optional onboarding guide that introduced the staged input workflow, addressing the digital literacy constraints where 100% of interviewed farmers reported no prior agricultural application. The onboarding screen included a "Don't show again" preference stored via SharedPreferences that allowed experienced users to bypass the introduction on subsequent launches. Input validation verified that required fields contained valid positive numeric values, displaying contextual error messages through Material Design Toast notifications when fields were incomplete or contained non-numeric input, preventing form submission until all validation criteria were satisfied.
Following pre-planting validation, the workflow proceeded to the nutrient management stage (in Fig. 28), implemented through NutrientManagementActivity. This stage captured the multi-application fertilization pattern observed during Phase 1 investigations, beginning with selection of the number of fertilizer application splits (2 or 3). For each application, farmers selected fertilizer formulation via dropdown and entered quantities with unit selection (kilograms or 50-kilogram sacks) to accommodate the measurement variability documented during requirements planning. 
 
Fig. 28. Control flow for the nutrient management stage showing fertilizer split selection, iterative application entry with automatic NPK calculation, and navigation to the pest management stage (Connector A→B).
 
Fig. 29. Control flow for the pest management stage showing pest selection, pesticide quantity entry, validation, and navigation to the weather conditions stage (Connector B→C).
The FertilizerUtils class automatically calculated total NPK values (three N/P/K triplets for up to three application stages) based on the selected fertilizer's NPK ratio and entered quantity, displaying the computed nutrient amounts to provide transparency while reducing the cognitive burden of manual nutrient computation. The fertilizer management stage implemented a loop control that enforced the maximum number of application splits selected by the farmer, preventing accidental over-entry of fertilization data.
The pest management stage (in Fig. 29), implemented through PestManagementActivity, provided binary presence indicators for the five key pest and disease categories identified through analysis. The checkbox-based interface enabled farmers to indicate which pests were observed or anticipated during the cropping season, with corresponding input fields for protecting product quantities when pests were selected. 
 
Fig. 30. Control flow for the weather conditions stage showing binary weather challenge input and navigation to prediction execution (Connector C→P).
The weather conditions stage (in Fig. 30), implemented through WeatherActivity, captured the binary weather challenge indicator through a straightforward checkbox, consistent with the constraint analysis that excluded continuous weather variables due to limited local measurement infrastructure while retaining the farmer-reported binary indicator for flooding, drought, or typhoon impacts that affected 80% of survey respondents (Table 9).
Following completion of all input stages, the application proceeded to prediction execution (in Fig. 31). In OutputActivity, the validated inputs stored in PredictionManager were used to construct the 27-element feature vector, and PredictionManager invoked the embedded Java model’s score() method to generate the yield prediction and displayed results with multiple presentation layers: primary prediction prominently shown with practical unit conversions, confidence indicator derived from test set performance, prediction range visualization (±15% of point estimate), feature importance bar chart generated through dynamic sensitivity analysis, contextual insights using Material Design Chip components, and agronomic recommendations based on input patterns. Users then choose whether to navigate to the history view for scenario comparison (Connector P→2) or return to the main page (Connector P→M).

The history management workflow (in Fig. 32) retrieved all stored prediction records from the local SQLite database via HistoryManager.getAllHistory() and presented them in reverse chronological order through a RecyclerView adapter in HistoryActivity. When no historical data existed (typically for first-time users), the application displayed a clear message indicating that no history had been saved, with navigation options to return to the main page or initiate a new prediction. When historical data were available, users could apply filtering options to view all predictions, recent predictions, or favorites only.

For each displayed record, users could tap to view full prediction details through PreviewActivity in history mode, compare scenarios across seasons supporting the longitudinal decision-making pattern identified in Phase 1, mark predictions as favorites for quick reference via the HistoryManager.setFavorite() method, or delete outdated records through the HistoryManager.deletePrediction() method invoked from long-press context menus. The history interface provided backward navigation through the Android back button that allowed users to return to the main page or continue reviewing stored predictions.
The implemented data flow and control flow architecture ensured that farmer inputs progressed systematically through validation, processing, and storage stages without requiring internet connectivity or external services. This design satisfied the functional requirements for offline prediction (FR1), stage-based input management (FR2), and historical record management (FR6), while supporting the usability requirements (NFR2) through clear navigation pathways, Material Design components, and error prevention mechanisms.
Functional requirements implementation and user interface
All six functional requirements derived from Phase 1 empirical analysis were implemented and verified through pre-deployment testing. This section presents the implementation evidence for each requirement with supporting user interface screenshots.
Requirement FR1: Offline Yield Prediction Capability. The application implemented complete offline prediction functionality by embedding the m2cgen-generated Java Random Forest model directly in the application package, with no network permissions declared in the Android manifest file. As shown in Fig. 33b, the home screen provided immediate access to the "Predict Palay Yield" function without requiring login, internet connectivity, or external service dependencies.

First-time users were presented with an optional onboarding guide (Fig. 33c) that introduced the staged input workflow, addressing the digital literacy constraints where 100% of interviewed farmers reported no prior agricultural application usage (Table 6, Theme I12). The onboarding screen implemented in PredictPalayActivity included a "Don't show again" checkbox stored via SharedPreferences that allowed experienced users to bypass the introduction on subsequent launches, balancing accessibility for novices with efficiency for repeat users.
The prediction workflow began with pre-planting data entry (Fig. 34a), implemented through PrePlantingActivity, which collected fundamental farm characteristics: land area in hectares, rice variety selection via dropdown, seed amount in

kilograms with automatic sack conversion, planting method via dropdown, and land preparation method checkboxes. Input validation verified that required fields contained valid positive numeric values, displaying contextual error messages (Fig. 34b) through Material Design Toast notifications when fields were incomplete or contained non-numeric input, preventing form submission until all validation criteria were satisfied (NFR5: error resilience).
Requirement FR2: Stage-Based Agricultural Input Management. The nutrient management interface (Fig. 35) implemented in NutrientManagementActivity captured the three-stage fertilization pattern observed in 100% of farmer interviews (Table 6, Theme I9). The workflow began with selection of the number of fertilizer application splits (Fig. 35a), with options for 2 or 3 applications corresponding to the basal, mid-season, and late-season timings documented in Phase 1 (Table 9). For each selected split, farmers provided fertilizer type via dropdown (Fig. 35b) choosing from five standardized formulations (Complete 14-14-14, Urea 46-0-0, Ammosul 21-0-0, Muriate of Potash 0-0-60, Complete 16-20-0) and quantity with unit selection (Fig. 35d-e) supporting both kilograms and 50-kilogram sacks to accommodate the measurement variability documented during requirements planning. The FertilizerUtils class automatically calculated total NPK values (three N/P/K triplets for up to three application stages) based on the selected fertilizer's NPK ratio and entered quantity, displaying the computed nutrient amounts to provide transparency while reducing the cognitive burden of manual nutrient computation. The completed nutrient management form displayed all application details with computed NPK totals before proceeding to the next stage.
Requirement FR4: Pest, Disease, and Water Management Recording. The pest management interface (Fig. 36) implemented in PestManagementActivity provided binary presence indicators for the five key pest and disease categories identified through thematic analysis: stem borer, rats, golden apple snail/kuhol, cutworms, and rice blast. The checkbox-based interface (Fig. 36a-b) enabled farmers to indicate which pests were observed or anticipated during the cropping season, with corresponding input fields for protection product quantities when pests were selected. This design reflected the IPM orientation documented in Phase 1, where 10 out of 11 interviewed farmers (Table 6, Theme I4) reported limited routine insecticide use with preventive timing emphasis rather than calendar-based spraying schedules.

The weather conditions screen (Fig. 37) implemented in WeatherActivity captured the binary weather challenge indicator through a straightforward checkbox, consistent with the constraint analysis (Table 8) that excluded continuous weather variables (rainfall, temperature, floods, typhoon, drought, etc.) due to limited local measurement infrastructure while retaining the farmer-reported binary indicator for flooding, drought, or typhoon impacts that affected 43 of 54 survey respondents (79.6%, Table 9).

Following completion of all input stages, the application presented a comprehensive review modal (Fig. 38a) implemented through PreviewActivity that displayed all entered data organized by category (pre-planting, nutrient management, pest management, weather conditions). This review interface provided a final verification opportunity before prediction execution, enabling users to identify and correct errors across all input categories in a single consolidated view. Upon confirmation, the PredictionManager.generatePrediction() method constructed the 27-element feature vector, invoked the embedded Java model's score() method, and returned a PredictionResult object containing the predicted yield, confidence score, insights, and recommendations.

Requirement FR5: Transparent Prediction Result Presentation. The results interface (Fig. 38b-c) implemented in OutputActivity provided multi-level transparency to address trust concerns identified during requirements planning. The simple results view (Fig. 38b) displayed the primary prediction prominently with practical unit conversions: yield in kilograms (model output), and sacks (÷50 kg, on-farm storage unit), enabling farmers to conceptualize the prediction in familiar terms. The confidence indicator, derived from the test set R² of 0.765 (Table 15), provided context for prediction reliability by reminding users of the model’s overall performance on unseen data. The detailed results view (Fig. 38c) expanded the presentation with a prediction range visualization (±15% of point estimate with headroom adjustment) implemented through custom view drawing that displayed the prediction as a vertical bar chart with upper and lower bounds, supporting the scenario analysis use case where farmers mentally bracket expected outcomes.
The feature importance visualization (Fig. 38d) represented a key transparency mechanism that translated the Random Forest model's internal importance scores into an accessible horizontal bar chart. Rather than relying solely on the static feature importances from the Python training phase, the application implemented dynamic sensitivity analysis through the PredictionManager.computeFeatureImportance() method, which perturbed each input feature by ±10% and measured the resulting change in predicted yield, ranking features by their marginal impact on the specific prediction. This approach provided personalized explanations showing which agronomic factors most strongly influenced the particular yield estimate. 
Requirement FR6: Historical Prediction Record Management. The history management interface (Fig. 39) implemented in HistoryActivity provided persistent local storage of prediction sessions through the HistoryManager class and Room database. The history list view (Fig. 39a-b) displayed saved predic stions in reverse chronological order with key summary information: timestamp, predicted yield, and favorite status indicator. The favorites feature (Fig. 39c) enabled farmers to bookmark particularly informative predictions for quick reference via the HistoryManager.setFavorite() method, supporting the scenario comparison use case identified during requirements planning where farmers mentally compared input variations. Tapping any history record opened the full prediction details through PreviewActivity in history mode, which displayed both the original inputs and prediction results without recalculation, enabling farmers to review past estimates and compare them with actual outcomes at harvest time.

The implemented user interface successfully operationalized all functional requirements through a combination of Material Design 3 components (MaterialAlertDialogBuilder, Chips, dropdowns, checkboxes), custom validation logic, automatic calculation features, and persistent local storage. The staged workflow organization aligned with the rice production activities familiar to farmers from Phase 1 interviews, while the transparency mechanisms (unit conversions, prediction ranges, feature importance, contextual insights) addressed the trust and interpretability concerns documented during requirements planning.
The implementation approach prioritized clear separation of concerns through the three-layer architecture, with the PredictionManager singleton class serving as the primary Business Logic component that coordinated data flow between the User Interface activities and the embedded Data/Model layer. Key implementation details demonstrating novel approaches for feature vector construction, dynamic sensitivity analysis, automatic NPK calculation via FertilizerUtils, and state management across the sequential workflow are presented in Appendix 9.
Non-functional requirements validation
The implemented application was designed to address the non-functional requirements specified during requirements planning (Table 11). This subsection summarizes how the current version of GabayPalay aligns with these requirements based on manifest inspection, code review, and pre-deployment manual testing. Table 16 summarizes the observed behavior of the prototype relative to the target specifications.
NFR1: Device Compatibility and Resource Optimization. The application supports Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above, covering the range of devices reported in Phase 1 surveys. The release APK size of 12.4 MB is well below the 50 MB target specified during requirements planning, facilitating offline distribution via Bluetooth and social media messaging platforms (e.g., Facebook Messenger). During manual testing on the available devices, no memory-related issues were observed when performing typical tasks such as entering inputs, generating predictions, and browsing history, suggesting that the application operates within the intended resource constraints for low-spec devices.
Table 16. Non-functional requirements validation results showing achieved specifications against target values for the GabayPalay mobile application.
ID	Requirement	Achieved / Status
NFR1	Device Compatibility and Resource Use	Supports Android 8.0 (API 26) and above; release APK size is 12.4 MB (well below the 50 MB target). No memory-related issues were observed during manual testing on typical farmer devices.
NFR2	Usability and Accessibility	Implements a staged, activity-based workflow with Material Design 3 components and clear navigation. Informal testing indicated that farmers could follow the workflow, but formal SUS scoring and potential Bisaya localization are deferred to the user acceptance and usability evaluation phase.
NFR3	Prediction Performance	Prediction responses appeared almost instantaneous and subjectively within the 3-second target during manual tests. The embedded m2cgen Java model produced numerically equivalent outputs to the Python baseline on the validation set (see Table 15). No formal performance profiling was conducted.
NFR4	Data Security and Privacy	No network permissions are declared; all data are stored locally using Room/SQLite in the app’s private directory, and no external SDKs or analytics are integrated. SQLite-level encryption was not implemented; instead, the prototype relies on Android’s application sandbox for data isolation.
NFR5	System Reliability and Error Handling	Input validation and contextual error messages were verified through manual negative testing (invalid/missing inputs). Basic try–catch handling is in place around critical operations, and no crashes were observed in the pre-deployment test scenarios, although exhaustive stress testing was not performed.

NFR2: Usability and Accessibility. The user interface employs a staged, activity-based workflow aligned with farming activities (pre-planting, fertilization, pest management, weather), using Material Design 3 components and clear navigation from the main screen to prediction and history functions. Informal testing by the researcher and initial use by farmers indicated that the workflow and labels were understandable, particularly when combined with the optional onboarding guide for first-time users. However, the current implementation uses English for all text and labels, while detailed SUS-based usability evaluation with farmers is reported in the subsequent chapter. Comprehensive usability assessment, including SUS scoring and exploration of Bisaya or mixed-language labels, is deferred to the user acceptance testing and usability evaluation presented in the next chapter.
NFR3: Prediction Performance and Responsiveness. No formal performance profiling (e.g., instrumented timing or benchmark scripts) was conducted. Nevertheless, during manual testing on the available devices, yield predictions were generated almost instantaneously and subjectively within the 3-second response time target, even when navigating through the full input workflow. The embedded m2cgen-generated Java model produced numerically equivalent outputs to the Python baseline on the 17 test samples used for parity checking (Table 15), indicating that the conversion process preserved prediction behavior for the evaluated cases. These observations suggest that the prototype’s prediction performance is adequate for interactive use in the intended deployment context, although more rigorous profiling could further quantify performance under a broader range of hardware configurations.
NFR4: Data Security and Privacy. Manifest inspection and code review confirmed that the application declares no network permissions and integrates no external analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs. All user data (farm inputs and prediction results) are stored locally via the Room persistence library in the application’s private directory, which is not accessible to other applications under normal conditions. This design enforces local-only storage and zero external transmission, addressing privacy and trust concerns raised during interviews and informed consent discussions. Full SQLite encryption was not implemented in the current prototype; instead, data protection relies on Android’s default application sandbox model. As such, the implementation meets the core requirement of local-only, offline data handling, while stronger encryption could be considered in future versions to further enhance data security.
NFR5: System Reliability and Error Handling. Input validation is applied at each stage of the workflow to prevent incomplete or invalid submissions. Manual negative testing (e.g., leaving required fields blank, entering non-numeric values where numbers are expected) confirmed that the application displays contextual error messages and prevents progression until issues are corrected. The PredictionManager maintains application state across activities, allowing users to navigate backward without losing entered data. Basic try–catch constructs are wrapped around critical operations such as database access and model invocation, and no crashes were observed during the pre-deployment test scenarios conducted by the researcher. However, exhaustive automated stress testing and long-term field reliability monitoring were beyond the scope of this study and are identified as areas for future work.
The observed behavior of the implemented application indicates that the targeted non-functional requirements are reasonably addressed within the limits of the current prototype, the tested devices, and the scope of pre-deployment evaluation. Offline operation and on-device data handling directly respond to connectivity and privacy constraints identified in Phase 1, while usability, performance, and reliability have been validated at an initial level and are further examined through structured user acceptance and usability evaluation in the subsequent chapter.
Application deployment and distribution
The completed application was packaged as an Android APK file for distribution to study participants. The deployment process prioritized accessibility in light of the connectivity constraints and device diversity documented during Phase 1.
The final release APK was generated through Android Studio’s build system with a release signing configuration, producing a 12.4 MB package compatible with devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above. This compatibility threshold encompassed the range of smartphone models reported by farmers in the study area during the Phase 1 surveys. The application was not published to the Google Play Store in order to avoid the requirement for active Google accounts and potential additional configuration overhead, which could have introduced barriers to adoption given the digital literacy constraints observed in Phase 1 (Table 6, Theme I12: 100% reported no prior agricultural app usage).
Distribution employed three complementary channels to accommodate farmer preferences and existing technology use patterns: (1) direct installation via laptop during face-to-face meetings with farmers, which allowed the researcher to assist with installation and demonstrate initial usage; (2) Bluetooth file transfer for farmers who preferred to install the application on their own devices without relying on internet connectivity; and (3) sharing via social media messaging platforms (e.g., Facebook Messenger) for farmers who were already comfortable downloading and opening files received through these channels. These distribution methods aligned with the communication patterns observed during Phase 1, where farmers frequently shared agricultural information and photos through messaging groups.
Installation instructions were provided verbally and visually during farmer meetings that illustrated the steps for enabling installation from unknown sources in Android settings, locating the downloaded APK file, and granting the necessary permissions during installation. The instructions emphasized that the application did not require an internet connection after installation and that all data would remain stored locally on the farmer’s device.
This deployment approach successfully delivered the application to the intended study participants while respecting the technological constraints and preferences documented during requirements planning. It also established the foundation for the subsequent user acceptance testing and usability evaluation, during which farmers’ actual experiences with the installed application (including language clarity, ease of use, and perceived usefulness) could be systematically assessed.
User Acceptance Testing and Usability Evaluation
Following implementation and internal validation of the GabayPalay application, user acceptance testing was conducted with rice farmers from Hagonoy, Davao del Sur to evaluate usability, perceived usefulness, and adoption potential. This section presents the results of RAD Phase 4 (Cutover and Validation), including participant characteristics, quantitative usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS), technology acceptance evaluation using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), qualitative user feedback, and task completion analysis that are briefly described in Appendix 10. The user evaluation provides empirical evidence for Requirement NFR2.
Participant demographics and characteristics
User acceptance testing involved 36 rice farmers from Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. Participants were identified with the help of associations and cooperatives, following the sampling procedures described in the methodology. Participants were drawn from the same locality as the Phase 1 interview (n = 11) and survey (n = 54) respondents, ensuring consistency in farming practices, environmental conditions, and technology access patterns that informed the requirements specification. Table 17 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the UAT participants.
The sample was predominantly male (83.3%), reflecting typical gender roles in farm management in Philippine rice systems. Ages ranged from early twenties to late fifties, with balanced representation across age cohorts. Educational attainment was mainly elementary and high school level (80.5% combined), similar to the Phase 1 survey profile, and consistent with the digital literacy constraints that motivated simplified interaction patterns under NFR2.
Daily smartphone usage was concentrated in the 1-3 hour range (38.9%), with over one-quarter of participants using smartphones less than 1 hour per day. This distribution indicates moderate but not intensive digital engagement and underscores the need for interfaces that remain usable for users with limited technology exposure. Prior agricultural app use was rare; 86.1% reported never having used any agricultural mobile application, while a small subset had experience with tools such as Rice Doctor, Rice Crop Manager, PlantNet, RiceAdvice, and postharvest quality tools. Farming experience ranged from 2 to 35 years (median 18 years), and farm sizes were characteristic of smallholder systems, with most participants managing 1–3 hectares. Overall, the UAT sample reflects the diversity and constraints of the intended user population.

System Usability Scale assessment
The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to quantify perceived usability. The instrument consists of ten items rated on a five-point Likert scale, converted to a composite score from 0 to 100 following Brooke's (1996) standard procedure. Summary statistics for the SUS scores of the 36 farmer participants are presented in Table 18. Item-level SUS responses, which provide more detailed insight into specific usability aspects such as ease of use, complexity, and need for support, are shown in Table 19.
The mean SUS score of 60.3 (SD = 19.5) is below the commonly cited benchmark of approximately 68 for clearly acceptable usability and below the target specified in NFR2. Using the interpretive ranges suggested by Bangor et al. (2009), this value corresponds to marginal to acceptable usability. The wide range (27.5 to 100.0) and high standard deviation indicate substantial variability in user experience: 41.7% of participants rated the system at or above 70, and 16.7% rated it at or above 80, while others assigned much lower scores. In the present sample, younger farmers, those with higher educational attainment, and those with more intensive smartphone use tended to assign higher SUS scores and to complete the workflow with fewer difficulties. This pattern is consistent with reports that usability and technology adoption in agriculture are strongly associated with education level and digital literacy (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). 
In contrast, elementary-educated farmers with less than one hour of daily smartphone usage often provided low SUS ratings and required more guidance. These findings align with the digital literacy and adoption constraints identified in the requirements phase and confirm that the interface is usable for a portion of the target population but challenging for users at the lower end of the digital literacy spectrum.
Table 18. Summary statistics for System Usability Scale scores (n = 36).
Overall SUS Score	Value	Interpretation
Mean SUS Score	60.3	Below acceptable threshold (Brooke, 1996; Bangor et al., 2009)
Standard Deviation	19.5	High variability across users
Minimum Score	27.5	Lowest individual rating
Maximum Score	100.0	Highest individual rating (perfect score)
Median Score	58.8	Central tendency indicator
Scores ≥70 (Acceptable)	15 (41.7%)	Proportion meeting acceptability threshold
Scores ≥80 (Excellent)	6 (16.7%)	Proportion rating as excellent

Item-level (shown in Table 19) means indicate generally positive responses to statements about ease of use, integration, and confidence (SUS3, SUS5, SUS7, SUS9), but also reveal concerns about needing technical support and the learning effort required (SUS4, SUS10). The relatively low scores for perceived inconsistency and cumbersomeness (SUS6, SUS8) suggest that the interface is structurally coherent, but that complexity arises from content and task demands rather than from inconsistent layout.
The SUS results indicate that GabayPalay has achieved moderate but not yet optimal usability. The system satisfies NFR2 only partially: the staged workflow and Material Design components help many users complete tasks, but additional refinements are needed to make the interface consistently usable across the full range of farmers.
Technology Acceptance Model evaluation
User acceptance was further evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model. Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) were each measured through five items on a five-point Likert scale. Table 20 summarizes the TAM results.

Table 19. Item-level System Usability Scale (SUS) scores for GabayPalay (n = 36).
Individual SUS Items*	Mean Score	Interpretation
SUS1	3.53	Moderate positive intention
SUS2	2.81	Moderate complexity perception
SUS3	3.75	Moderate to high ease of use perception
SUS4	3.19	Moderate support dependency
SUS5	3.58	Good integration perception
SUS6	2.50	Low inconsistency perception
SUS7	3.58	Moderate learnability perception
SUS8	2.50	Low awkwardness perception
SUS9	3.78	Moderate to high confidence
SUS10	3.11	Moderate learning barrier
* Complete SUS item statements are included in Appendix 6.
PU scores were generally high, with most items receiving mean ratings close to or above 4.0. These patterns suggest that farmers recognized GabayPalay as a helpful decision-support tool, especially for estimating potential yield and planning fertilizer use. This observation is consistent with the documented need for more systematic input planning and yield prediction in smallholder rice farming and supports the design choices underlying the application’s core functions, such as offline yield prediction, stage-based input management, and the provision of clear prediction outputs and historical records.
PEOU scores were comparatively lower and more varied. The overall PEOU mean of 3.37 reflects a moderate level of ease of use. Item-level means suggest that most users were able to learn and navigate the system, but that several parts of the workflow required noticeable effort. These results align with the SUS findings and with qualitative feedback, where users frequently mentioned difficulties with fertilizer selection, switching between kilograms and sacks, interpreting the NPK display, and understanding some aspects of the prediction results. Farmers with greater smartphone experience and higher educational attainment tended to report fewer issues, while those with elementary education or limited daily smartphone use more often expressed uncertainty and required assistance.
Within the TAM framework, the combination of relatively high PU and only moderate PEOU indicates that GabayPalay offers a clear value proposition but that ease-of-use limitations may restrict wider and sustained adoption. Farmers appear willing to invest effort to use the application because they perceive concrete benefits in terms of planning and accuracy; however, the current usability level still poses challenges for users with lower digital literacy. This configuration is similar to patterns reported in other agricultural technology studies, where functional advantages can motivate initial trial, but improvements in ease of use, clarity, and cognitive load are important for encouraging continued independent use and peer recommendation.

PEOU5: Overall ease of use	3.50	1.00	Moderate ease perception
Net Promoter Score (NPS)	6.83	1.95	Good recommendation likelihood 
Net promoter score and qualitative feedback
Willingness to recommend the application was assessed using a single Net Promoter Score (NPS) item rated from 0 to 10. Based on standard categorization, 9 respondents (25.0%) were Promoters (9-10), 11 (30.6%) were Passives (7-8), and 16 (44.4%) were Detractors (0-6), resulting in an NPS of -19.4.
The negative NPS indicates that, at this prototype stage, detractors outnumber promoters, and spontaneous recommendations to peers are not yet assured. However, qualitative feedback clarifies that many detractors cited specific usability difficulties rather than a lack of perceived value. Positive comments frequently emphasized the benefits of having a calculator for fertilizer, a structured prediction process, and clear yield estimates. Several participants compared GabayPalay favorably with other tools they had used, noting that it combined multiple decision-support functions in one application.
Recurring challenges identified in open-ended responses and observation logs included confusion about NPK displays, difficulties selecting fertilizers and understanding units (kilograms versus sacks), uncertainty about where to start prediction or locate the Predict button, and challenges in configuring multiple fertilizer applications or selecting pests. These comments explain the moderate PEOU and SUS scores and highlight concrete areas for interface refinement.
Language emerged repeatedly as a barrier. Several farmers explicitly recommended that the application be localized into Bisaya or include vernacular labels and explanations, stating that this would make it easier for typical users in their community to operate the app without assistance. This feedback directly reinforces the original intent of NFR2 to include multilingual accessibility and confirms that deferring Bisaya localization likely contributed to the observed usability limitations.
These results indicate that the application is functionally valuable and usable for a subset of farmers, particularly those with higher digital literacy, but that it does not yet fully meet the usability expectations for the broader population of smallholder farmers in Hagonoy. The combination of relatively high Perceived Usefulness, moderate Perceived Ease of Use, and a negative Net Promoter Score is consistent with findings from studies on agricultural ICT tools, where technical robustness and agronomic relevance are necessary but not sufficient; interface simplicity, language localization, and effective onboarding are also critical for widespread adoption.
