Summary and conclusion
This study developed and evaluated GabayPalay, an offline mobile application designed to predict rice yield based on farmer-controlled agronomic inputs in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. The research addressed persistent challenges in rice productivity optimization through a three-phase approach: empirical investigation of farming practices and technology use, development of a Random Forest prediction model with mobile deployment, and usability evaluation with target users.
Summary of Key Findings
Mixed-methods investigation revealed universal reliance on experience-based decision-making among rice farmers, with 100% of interview participants (n = 11) reporting no prior use of agricultural mobile applications (Table 6, Theme I12). Despite the documented benefits of digital tools in other rice-producing areas of Davao del Sur, Hagonoy farmers depended primarily on intuition, seasonal rhythms, and intermittent technician advice for critical production decisions. This finding aligned with broader patterns of limited digital literacy and connectivity constraints identified in Philippine rice systems (Angchay et al., 2024), while simultaneously revealing substantial yield variability (1,220 to 20,790 kg, Table 9) that suggested significant opportunity for decision support.
Documented farming practices followed consistent seasonal patterns organized around three-stage fertilization, transplanting-based establishment, and preventive pest management targeting stem borer and golden apple snail. These patterns provided the empirical foundation for structuring the application's input workflow and feature set, ensuring alignment between system capabilities and actual farm operations. Key factors for improved rice productivity included optimized seed rates, precise multi-stage fertilization timing, and preventive pest management at critical establishment windows (molluscicide timing around transplanting, herbicide at early growth stages).
Within this context, the study extended the application of Random Forest ensemble learning to localized rice yield prediction in a Philippine municipal setting. The Random Forest regressor trained on 27 farmer-controlled input variables achieved R² = 0.765 on the held-out test set (n = 17 farms), explaining approximately 76.5% of yield variance with RMSE of 2,286 kg/ha. This performance exceeded the Linear Regression baseline (R² = 0.572) and avoided the overfitting exhibited by ANN implementations in comparable Philippine rice studies (David, 2023). The optimal configuration (200 trees, max_depth = 10, Table 13) balanced predictive accuracy against mobile deployment constraints, successfully converting to standalone Java code with 100% numerical parity through the m2cgen transpilation process. Feature importance analysis revealed that variety selection, second-application nitrogen timing, and land area emerged as dominant yield predictors, consistent with established agronomic literature emphasizing variety–nutrient interactions and scale effects (Dait, 2023; Koirala et al., 2013).
The feature engineering approach, which standardized commercial fertilizer formulations to NPK nutrient content through automated calculation, addressed a practical data representation challenge specific to smallholder farming systems where product-based reporting prevails over elemental nutrient tracking. At the same time, the exclusion of weather variables (rainfall, temperature, wind speed) due to data unavailability, as documented in the constraint analysis, likely contributed to unexplained variance, given that environmental factors significantly influence Philippine rice yields (Dait, 2023; David, 2023).
The implemented GabayPalay application operationalized all six functional requirements through a three-layer architecture separating user interface, business logic, and data persistence. Key implementation achievements included complete offline prediction capability through embedded model code (FR1), stage-based fertilizer input with automatic NPK standardization (FR2, Fig. 35), and historical record management supporting longitudinal decision-making (FR6, Fig. 39). The 12.4 MB APK size and subjectively instantaneous prediction response addressed device compatibility and performance requirements (NFR1, NFR3, Table 16), while the use of Material Design 3 components and activity-based workflow organization targeted usability for low-literacy contexts (NFR2). Distribution through multiple channels (direct installation, Bluetooth APK transfer, Google Drive links) successfully delivered the application to 36 farmers for acceptance testing, accommodating diverse connectivity constraints and technology access patterns documented during requirements planning.
User acceptance testing revealed a bifurcated response pattern strongly associated with educational attainment and digital experience. The mean System Usability Scale score of 60.3 (SD = 19.5) fell below the acceptable threshold of 68 (Bangor et al., 2009; Brooke, 1996), with only 41.7% of participants achieving scores ≥ 70. Participants with college-level education and higher smartphone usage (>3 hours daily) generally provided favorable ratings, while elementary-educated farmers with minimal smartphone exposure reported substantial difficulties with navigation, input interpretation, and fertilizer unit conversion. The wide SUS score range (27.5–100.0) further illustrated the heterogeneity in digital literacy and comfort with mobile interfaces.
Technology Acceptance Model assessment indicated high Perceived Usefulness (mean = 3.97, Table 20), particularly for yield prediction accuracy (PU4: 4.17) and time-saving in planning (PU3: 4.08), suggesting that farmers recognized the application's value proposition. However, Perceived Ease of Use remained moderate (mean = 3.37), with item-level scores revealing challenges in learnability (PEOU1: 3.14) and cognitive load (PEOU4: 3.25). The negative Net Promoter Score (–19.4%) confirmed that current usability barriers limited spontaneous recommendation likelihood, despite functional utility. Qualitative feedback consistently identified language as the primary barrier, with multiple participants explicitly requesting Bisaya localization to improve comprehension of technical terms, input labels, and guidance text. Additional recurring challenges included confusion about NPK nutrient displays, difficulties understanding fertilizer product selection and unit conversion (kilograms versus sacks), and navigation uncertainty during multi-stage input workflows.
Taken together, these results show that the study systematically addressed its three research objectives. For the first objective, investigation revealed that farmers’ lack of mobile application usage stemmed from zero baseline exposure rather than active rejection, with decision-making relying on experience, technician advice, and seasonal rhythms. For the second objective, the Random Forest–based GabayPalay application achieved meaningful prediction performance (R² = 0.765) and realized all specified functional requirements within documented non-functional constraints, including offline deployment and context-aligned workflows. For the third objective, the combination of a mean SUS score of 60.3 (target ≥ 70), high Perceived Usefulness (3.97), moderate Perceived Ease of Use (3.37), and a negative NPS (–19.4%) demonstrated that while the application delivered recognized value, it did not yet achieve inclusive usability across the target farmer population’s digital literacy spectrum.
Beyond addressing the objectives, the study offered both theoretical and practical contributions. It demonstrated that models trained solely on farmer-reported management data can achieve useful predictive performance without depending on sensor networks or remote sensing. It showed how systematic derivation of requirements from empirical farming practice investigation can produce context-specific application designs that align with farmers’ seasonal workflows rather than abstract agronomic categories. It also documented concrete barriers to agricultural technology adoption among non-app users in a high-performing rice municipality, complementing prior research focused on farmers already engaged with digital tools (Angchay et al., 2024; Gabrillo and Torres, 2022). At the same time, the study was constrained by limited sample size (54 farms), absence of environmental variables, lack of controlled comparisons with alternative interfaces, and the absence of longitudinal deployment data, all of which shaped the scope and generalizability of the findings.
Overall, the development and evaluation of GabayPalay demonstrated that offline mobile applications embedding Random Forest models can deliver meaningful rice yield prediction capabilities to smallholder farmers in Philippine municipal contexts, addressing documented gaps in agricultural technology access for non-app users in high-performing rice production areas. However, the diverged usability outcomes underscore that technical functionality and predictive performance are necessary but insufficient conditions for inclusive technology adoption. Achieving widespread farmer benefit requires explicit design attention to language localization, literacy-appropriate interface patterns, and culturally grounded presentation of agronomic concepts, areas where the current implementation fell short for substantial user segments despite delivering recognized value to higher-literacy participants.
Recommendations for Future Work
Immediate development priorities should focus on completing Bisaya language localization as the highest-impact enhancement. Translating all interface text, input labels, technical terms, and guidance messages, and framing them in culturally appropriate agronomic language, is critical given the consistent user feedback identifying language as the primary barrier. Localization should go beyond direct translation to incorporate locally familiar terminology for fertilizer products and measurement units, ensuring that explanations of concepts such as nutrient content and timing are expressed in forms that align with farmers’ everyday communication and extension experiences.
Interface redesign should directly address documented confusion points. Fertilizer selection screens can be improved by displaying visual product images alongside text labels to better support brand-based recognition, while unit conversions between kilograms and sacks should include automatic calculation with clear equivalency indicators. NPK displays should be paired with plain-language explanations (for example, “Nitrogen for leaf growth: X kg”) rather than relying solely on technical notation, and navigation should incorporate clear visual progress indicators showing completion status across input stages. These changes would reduce cognitive load and better support farmers with lower formal education and limited smartphone familiarity.
Contextual help features should be integrated throughout the input workflow, providing on-demand explanations of technical terms, measurement guidance, and examples of locally typical input values. Such help mechanisms should prioritize visual and vernacular presentation over text-heavy documentation, potentially incorporating short video demonstrations or illustrated guides accessible within each input screen. This would respond to the observed help dependency and give farmers a way to revisit instructions without relying on external assistance.
Model enhancement and expansion should prioritize larger and more diverse datasets to strengthen predictive performance and robustness. Increasing the sample size beyond 54 farms, while maintaining diversity in farm sizes, management practices, and seasonal conditions, would enable more reliable modeling, particularly at yield extremes where current prediction errors were higher. Integrating environmental variables such as rainfall and temperature through collaboration with local weather stations or satellite data providers would further improve explanatory power, although this will require careful consideration of how to deliver such data within an offline-first architecture, for instance through periodic updates when connectivity is available.
Alternative modeling approaches, including ensemble stacking that combines Random Forest with gradient boosting or neural network components, could be explored to enhance accuracy while preserving interpretability through feature importance analysis. Implementing mechanisms for periodic model retraining as new farm data collected would support continuous improvement in prediction quality across multiple seasons and evolving management practices.
Longitudinal evaluation and impact assessment are essential to determine whether GabayPalay produces meaningful changes in real-world decision-making and productivity. As part of these longitudinal deployments, predicted yields should be systematically compared not only with individual farm harvests but also with documented minimum, average, and maximum yields for Hagonoy and comparable municipalities. Such comparisons would help verify the credibility of the model against established local yield benchmarks and identify systematic over‑ or under‑prediction patterns. Extended field deployment over multiple cropping seasons should monitor actual usage patterns, adoption trajectories, and the extent to which farmers incorporate predictions into planting and fertilization decisions. Comparative studies between users and non-users, as well as between different interface variants and guidance formats, would clarify which design and training strategies most effectively improve usability and sustained adoption across literacy levels. Impact assessment should extend beyond individual farm outcomes to examine potential effects on community-level practices, knowledge sharing patterns, and broader technology adoption cascades, including whether early adopters influence peer adoption and whether app-based recommendations diffuse to non-users through social learning.
Platform and distribution strategies should be strengthened through integration with existing agricultural extension systems and farmer cooperatives. Partnerships with institutions such as the Hagonoy Farmers Multi-Purpose Cooperative and the Municipal Agriculture Office could facilitate structured training programs, peer mentoring arrangements, and collective troubleshooting that address usability barriers through social support mechanisms. Offline content delivery approaches, including Bluetooth sharing or physical media, should be maintained alongside any future app store deployment to reach farmers in areas with limited connectivity. While cross-platform development (e.g., iOS or progressive web app versions) may be considered in the long term, resource allocation should prioritize improving Android accessibility and usability, given the documented device landscape in the target population.
The development and evaluation of GabayPalay contribute practical evidence that advanced machine learning capabilities can be embedded in resource-constrained mobile environments to support agricultural decision-making in connectivity-limited contexts. At the same time, the mixed acceptance results reinforce that technological capability must be matched by user-centered design and institutional support mechanisms to bridge adoption barriers rooted in digital literacy, language accessibility, and trust. Future iterations incorporating vernacular localization, interface simplification informed by observed usability challenges, and longitudinal deployment with extension system integration offer plausible pathways toward realizing the application's potential to improve rice productivity outcomes for Hagonoy farmers and comparable smallholder populations across Philippine rice systems.
