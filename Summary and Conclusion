SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

This chapter synthesizes the research findings from the development and evaluation of GabayPalay, a mobile application designed to predict rice yield for farmers in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. The discussion integrates insights across all phases of the Rapid Application Development methodology, draws conclusions addressing the research objectives, and proposes directions for future work based on empirical evidence.
Overview of the Research
This research addressed the need for accessible agricultural decision support tools among rice farmers in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, through the development of GabayPalay, an offline mobile application that predicts rice yield based on agronomic inputs. The study employed a comprehensive methodology integrating mixed-methods research, machine learning model development, and mobile application engineering within the Rapid Application Development framework proposed by Dennis (2023).
The research pursued three primary objectives: investigating farming practices and technology usage patterns while identifying productivity factors through field research; designing and implementing a mobile application utilizing Random Forest regression for yield prediction; and assessing the application's usability and perceived usefulness through systematic user acceptance testing with 36 farmers.
Requirements Planning. Qualitative interviews with 11 farmers and quantitative surveys with 54 farmers revealed consistent transplanting practices, universal multi-stage fertilization patterns (2-3 applications per season), and zero baseline agricultural app usage despite moderate smartphone ownership (Theme I12, Table 7). The requirements planning systematically derived six functional requirements (FR1-FR6) addressing offline prediction, stage-based input management, variety classification, pest recording, transparent results, and historical records, alongside five non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR5) specifying device compatibility, usability targets (SUS greater than or equal to 70), performance, security, and reliability. Critically, comprehensive constraint documentation (Table 12) anticipated digital literacy gaps, technical terminology confusion, variable measurement practices, seasonal usage patterns, and data availability limitations as barriers to adoption.

Model Development and Validation. The Random Forest regression model incorporated 27 input features capturing pre-planting variables, three-stage fertilization patterns, pest management practices, and environmental factors. Systematic hyperparameter optimization through grid search with 3-fold cross-validation identified the optimal configuration (200 trees, max depth 10), achieving strong predictive performance on the held-out test set (R²=0.765, RMSE=2,286 kg/ha, MAE=1,731 kg/ha). The model was successfully converted from Python to Kotlin using m2cgen with 100% perfect numerical parity (Table 16), enabling offline mobile deployment without server dependencies.

Application Development. The Android application was implemented in Kotlin with a three-layer modular architecture, successfully delivering all six functional requirements as validated through functional testing (Table 17). The application achieved offline prediction capability, stage-based fertilizer input with automatic NPK calculation, variety classification with seed rate validation, pest management recording, transparent result presentation with feature importance visualization, and historical record management through Room database persistence. However, usability and multilingual accessibility (NFR2) was only partially met, with English-only implementation (Bisaya deferred due to timeline constraints) and the target SUS score not achieved in user acceptance testing.

User Evaluation. User acceptance testing with 36 farmers yielded mixed results. The System Usability Scale assessment produced a mean score of 60.3 (SD=19.5), falling below the acceptability threshold of 70 despite simplified interface design and visual guidance. However, Technology Acceptance Model evaluation revealed high Perceived Usefulness (M=3.97) substantially exceeding moderate Perceived Ease of Use (M=3.37), with farmers strongly recognizing value in prediction accuracy (4.17) and time savings (4.08) despite encountering usability barriers. The negative Net Promoter Score (-19.4%) and predominance of Detractors (44.4%) confirmed that usability challenges, rather than lack of functional value, represented the primary adoption barrier. Specific challenges included NPK display confusion (27.8%), fertilizer selection difficulty (25.0%), unit conversion confusion (22.2%), and help dependency (22.2%), directly validating the constraints documented during requirements planning.

Key Findings and Implications
Based on the systematic investigation conducted through the four phases of the Rapid Application Development methodology, the following conclusions address the research objectives and contribute to understanding of agricultural decision support tool development for smallholder rice farming contexts in the Philippines.

Farming Practices, Technology Use, and Productivity Factors
The research successfully identified current farming practices among rice farmers in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, and determined key factors influencing rice productivity through comprehensive field investigation. Several critical conclusions emerged from this investigation.

Farming practices demonstrate consistency within conventional patterns but substantial variation in input management. All farmers in the study employed transplanting as their establishment method and followed multi-stage fertilization patterns with 2-3 applications per season, aligning with national recommendations and irrigated lowland rice production norms documented in literature. However, substantial heterogeneity existed in specific input quantities, with seed rates varying two-fold (15-30 kg/ha) and total season fertilizer varying three-fold (approximately 4-12 sacks per hectare). This combination of consistent agronomic structure with variable input intensity suggests that while farmers understand appropriate timing for interventions, optimization of quantities represents an opportunity for data-driven decision support.

Agricultural mobile application usage is effectively zero despite moderate smartphone ownership. The finding that 100% of qualitative interview participants and 86.1% of user acceptance testing participants had never used farm-specific agricultural mobile applications, despite moderate smartphone ownership and daily usage, indicates a substantial gap between device availability and agricultural technology adoption. This gap cannot be attributed solely to lack of awareness, as government extension programs including the Digital Farmers Program 103 have promoted agricultural apps in the region. Rather, the zero baseline usage reflects deeper barriers including digital literacy limitations, mismatch between app functionality and farmer needs, inadequate support for independent usage, and preference for interpersonal information sources (technicians, peers, YouTube) over formal digital tools.

Key productivity factors align with agronomic theory while revealing opportunities for input optimization. The Random Forest model's identification of nitrogen from first and second fertilizer applications as top predictors of yield variability confirms agronomic understanding that timely nutrient availability during vegetative and reproductive growth stages critically influences productivity. The model's achieved performance (R²=0.765) indicates that 76.5% of yield variance can be explained by farmer-controllable inputs (fertilization, pest management, variety selection, land preparation) and environmental factors (weather challenges), suggesting substantial opportunity for productivity enhancement through improved input management. The remaining 23.5% unexplained variance likely reflects unmeasured factors including soil quality heterogeneity, microclimate variation, water management precision, harvest timing, and post-harvest handling, indicating limits to prediction accuracy achievable without more granular data collection.

Decision-making processes remain primarily experience-based with limited formal optimization. Farmers demonstrated sophisticated implicit knowledge of rice production requirements, accumulated through decades of experience (median 18 years) and intergenerational knowledge transfer. However, this experience-based approach operates largely through heuristics and visual cues (leaf color, plant vigor, pest incidence) rather than quantitative optimization. The wide variation in input quantities achieving similar yields (e.g., farms using 4 sacks versus 12 sacks per hectare achieving comparable productivity) indicates inefficiencies that could potentially be reduced through data-driven recommendations, though such recommendations must be presented in formats aligned with existing mental models to achieve acceptance.

Mobile Application Development with Machine Learning Integration
The research successfully designed and implemented a functional mobile application utilizing the Random Forest model for rice yield prediction, though with important caveats regarding usability achievement.

Offline machine learning deployment is technically feasible for smallholder agricultural contexts. The successful conversion of the Python scikit-learn Random Forest model to Kotlin using m2cgen, achieving 100% perfect numerical parity across all test cases, demonstrates that sophisticated machine learning models can be embedded directly into mobile applications without requiring internet connectivity or server infrastructure. This offline capability is essential for Philippine agricultural contexts where connectivity remains intermittent and expensive, and it addresses the data sovereignty concerns farmers expressed about sharing farm information externally. The modest application size (12.4 MB APK) and successful execution on diverse farmer-owned devices (Android 8.0-13.0, 2-4 GB RAM, various manufacturers) confirms that resource-constrained deployment is achievable without requiring farmers to upgrade hardware.

Systematic requirements derivation from empirical farmer research enables functional alignment with actual needs. The staged input workflow implementing the three-phase fertilization pattern documented in 100% of qualitative interviews, the binary hybrid-inbred variety classification reflecting the 83.3% hybrid preference observed in surveys, the pest management module addressing the five key challenges identified through thematic analysis, and the offline capability responding to zero baseline app usage and connectivity constraints all demonstrated successful translation of empirical observations into functional specifications. The high Perceived Usefulness scores in user acceptance testing (PU=3.97) validated that this requirements derivation process produced features farmers recognized as valuable, even when usability barriers constrained their ability to access that value.

Functional completeness can be achieved but does not automatically ensure usability. All six functional requirements (FR1-FR6) were successfully implemented and validated through task completion by user acceptance testing participants. Farmers completed offline predictions, entered data through the staged workflow, recorded pest management practices, viewed results with feature importance visualizations, and saved predictions to history. However, the below-threshold System Usability Scale score (60.3) demonstrated that functional capability does not automatically translate to acceptable ease of use, particularly for populations with limited digital literacy and zero baseline agricultural app usage. This finding highlights a critical distinction in agricultural technology development: delivering required functionality is necessary but insufficient for adoption.

Technical agricultural terminology creates comprehension barriers despite visual design. The confusion regarding NPK display reported by 27.8% of users, fertilizer selection difficulty experienced by 25.0%, and results interpretation challenges noted by 11.1% demonstrate that technical terminology presents significant barriers even when embedded within simplified visual interfaces. Farmers could successfully select familiar fertilizer brand names but struggled to understand the underlying nutrient composition calculations the application presented for transparency. This finding suggests tension between scientific accuracy and accessible communication: providing transparent explanations through technical terminology (NPK ratios, nutrient quantities) can paradoxically reduce comprehension for users unfamiliar with formal agricultural chemistry, even when such users possess sophisticated implicit knowledge of fertilizer effects through years of practical experience.

The English-only implementation significantly contributed to below-threshold usability. While direct measurement of language impact was not possible within the single-language deployment, the correlation between educational attainment and usability (elementary graduates achieving mean SUS of 38.5 versus college graduates achieving 77.1) suggests that literacy and language comprehension strongly mediated interface effectiveness. The requirements specification originally included bilingual English-Bisaya support recognizing that farmers rely on Bisaya for daily agricultural communication, yet this requirement was deferred due to development timeline constraints. The decision to proceed with English-only implementation represented a methodological compromise that likely contributed substantially to the observed usability challenges, particularly for the 33.3% of users with elementary education who may have had limited English proficiency despite demonstrating functional literacy in survey completion.

Usability and Technology Acceptance Assessment
The research comprehensively assessed the ease of use and perceived usefulness of the GabayPalay application through systematic user acceptance testing with 36 rice farmers, yielding critical insights about agricultural technology adoption barriers.

High perceived usefulness coexists with low perceived ease of use, creating adoption barriers despite recognized value. The Technology Acceptance Model evaluation revealed that farmers strongly recognized the application's value (PU=3.97), particularly for yield prediction accuracy (4.17) and time savings in planning (4.08), yet this high utility perception was accompanied by moderate ease of use (PEOU=3.37). The 0.60-point gap between PU and PEOU, combined with the negative Net Promoter Score (negative 19.4%) where Detractors outnumbered Promoters, demonstrates that perceived usefulness is necessary but insufficient for technology acceptance when usability falls below a critical threshold. Farmers understand the application could help their decision-making but find it too difficult to use independently, creating a paradox where the tool addresses genuine needs yet faces adoption resistance.

Digital literacy represents the dominant barrier to agricultural technology adoption, more so than feature relevance or connectivity. The strong correlations between System Usability Scale scores and educational attainment (college: 77.1 versus elementary: 38.5), daily smartphone usage (more than 5 hours: 81.5 versus less than 1 hour: 37.0), and prior agricultural app experience (with experience: 80.0 versus without: 57.1) demonstrate that technological familiarity, rather than agricultural relevance or functional completeness, determines usability perceptions. This finding challenges assumptions that low agricultural technology adoption primarily reflects irrelevant features or poor connectivity. The GabayPalay application addressed farmer-validated needs through offline functionality, yet 58.3% of users found it difficult to use. The implication is that expanding agricultural technology adoption requires addressing digital literacy gaps through training, support networks, and interface simplifications beyond those achievable through standard usability engineering practices.

Usability achievement varies dramatically across user capability segments, invalidating single-interface approaches. The 18-fold variation in task completion times (5-90 minutes) and the wide SUS score range (27.5-100.0) demonstrate that the target farmer population spans multiple orders of magnitude in technological capability. The 16.7% of users achieving excellent usability (SUS greater than or equal to 80) and the 16.7% reporting no difficulties whatsoever confirm that the simplified interface design successfully accommodated technologically proficient users. However, the 58.3% scoring below acceptable usability and the 44.4% classified as Detractors indicate that a single interface cannot effectively serve users spanning from college-educated daily smartphone users to elementary-educated farmers with less than one hour daily device usage. This heterogeneity suggests that agricultural applications targeting entire farming populations require either capability-based interface adaptations (simplified modes for low-literacy users, advanced features for proficient users) or acceptance that only a subset of the target population will achieve independent usage, necessitating peer support networks for others.

Specific usability barriers cluster around terminology, measurement standardization, and interaction complexity. The challenges reported by substantial user proportions—NPK display confusion (27.8%), fertilizer selection difficulty (25.0%), unit conversion confusion (22.2%), and help dependency (22.2%)—provide actionable insights beyond generic calls for improved usability. These barriers reflect tensions between scientific precision (standardized NPK ratios, kilogram measurements) and farmer practices (brand name selections, sack quantities), as well as between digital interaction patterns (multi-step workflows, dropdown selections, dynamic forms) and traditional information processing (oral communication, visual observation, heuristic decision rules). Addressing these specific barriers through contextual help, dual-unit displays, visual guides, and Bisaya localization represents a tractable path toward usability improvement, more concrete than abstract design recommendations.

The requirements specification process accurately predicted adoption challenges but underestimated their severity. The constraint analysis documented in Table 12 anticipated digital literacy gaps, confusion with agronomic terminology, variable measurement units, and limited form-based data entry experience as barriers to usability. User acceptance testing empirically validated all five documented constraints, confirming the accuracy of the requirements planning process. However, the magnitude of impact was underestimated: the constraint analysis suggested these barriers could be adequately mitigated through simplified interaction patterns and visual guidance to achieve the SUS target of 70 or higher, yet the achieved score of 60.3 indicates these interventions were insufficient. This finding suggests that requirements specifications for low-literacy populations should employ conservative usability targets (perhaps SUS greater than or equal to 80 for general populations should be SUS greater than or equal to 60 for low-literacy contexts) or alternatively should mandate pilot usability testing with representative users before finalizing interface designs.

Future Directions
Based on the findings and conclusions of this research, the following recommendations are proposed for immediate application improvements, deployment strategies, future research directions, and broader implications for agricultural technology development in Philippine smallholder farming contexts.

Application Enhancement Priorities
Implement Bisaya localization as the highest priority enhancement. All English labels, instructions, error messages, and contextual help should be translated to Bisaya, the local language used by farmers in Hagonoy for daily agricultural communication. This localization should extend beyond simple word-for-word translation to culturally appropriate terminology that aligns with local agricultural extension vocabulary and farmer mental models. Given that Bisaya translation was originally specified in NFR2 but deferred due to development timeline constraints, and that educational attainment showed the strongest correlation with usability (elementary graduates achieving mean SUS of 38.5), language accessibility likely represents the single highest-impact intervention for improving usability among the 33.3% of users with elementary education and limited English proficiency.

Add contextual help for technical agricultural terminology. Implement inline tooltips or expandable help sections that explain technical terms in plain Bisaya language with visual examples. Specifically, the NPK display that confused 27.8% of users should include contextual explanations such as "Nitrogen (N) para sa dahon ug pagtubo" (Nitrogen for leaves and growth), "Phosphorus (P) para sa gamut ug bulak" (Phosphorus for roots and flowering), "Potassium (K) para sa kusog sa tanum ug resistensya sa sakit" (Potassium for plant strength and disease resistance). These explanations should be accessible through tap-to-expand interactions rather than displayed by default, allowing proficient users to proceed quickly while providing support for users unfamiliar with formal nutrient terminology.

Simplify the fertilizer selection interface through visual matching. Add photographs of common local fertilizer packages to enable visual product identification, supplementing the current text-based dropdown selection that confused 25.0% of users. Implement a searchable database mapping local brand names (e.g., "Urea Gold," "Atlas") to standardized NPK formulations, or provide an "Other Fertilizer" option with guided manual NPK ratio entry for products not in the predefined list. This enhancement acknowledges that farmers recognize fertilizers by brand and packaging rather than by abstract NPK formulations, reducing cognitive translation burden while maintaining input precision for model predictions.

Provide dual-unit displays throughout the application. Replace unit selection dropdowns with automatic dual-unit presentation showing both kilograms and sack equivalents simultaneously (e.g., "25 kg (½ sack at 50 kg per sack)"). This approach accommodates both mental models without requiring users to perform conversions or make explicit unit selections that confused 22.2% of participants. Extend this dual-unit approach to results presentation, showing predicted yields in kilograms, cavans, and sacks simultaneously to provide multiple reference points aligned with different usage contexts (scientific reporting, traditional measurement, commercial transactions).

Implement proactive input validation with contextual feedback. Add real-time validation during data entry that provides immediate feedback when entered values fall outside typical ranges observed in the quantitative survey. For example, if a user enters 60 kg per hectare seed rate (above the observed range of 15-40 kg/ha), display an advisory message: "Ang kantidad mas taas kaysa average sa Hagonoy nga 25 kg/ha. Padayon ba?" (This quantity is higher than Hagonoy's average of 25 kg/ha. Continue?). This proactive validation addresses the 22.2% of users who needed to go back and correct input mistakes, catching errors early rather than requiring workflow reversal to make corrections after review screen detection.

Develop video tutorials in Bisaya demonstrating the complete workflow. Create 2-3 minute video demonstrations showing a local farmer completing a full prediction workflow, narrated in Bisaya with on-screen text highlighting key interaction points. These videos should be embedded within the application for offline viewing and should feature scenarios relevant to different farm scales and input patterns (small farm with 2 fertilizer applications, medium farm with 3 applications, etc.). Video tutorials address the 22.2% who needed help from others by providing on-demand assistance that simulates peer guidance without requiring another person's physical presence. Research on adult learning for low-literacy populations demonstrates that video demonstrations are more effective than text-based instructions for procedural knowledge transfer.

Deployment and Scaling Strategies
Establish community-based training programs delivered by agricultural extension workers. Given that 58.3% of users found the application difficult to use independently and 22.2% needed help from others during supervised testing, independent adoption through app store downloads is unlikely to succeed. Implement face-to-face training sessions (60-90 minutes per farmer) conducted by Municipal Agriculture Office extension workers or trained barangay technicians, following the collaborative learning model documented in the qualitative phase where farmers rely on technician advice and peer networks. Training should occur during the pre-planting period when farmers are actively planning fertilizer purchases, maximizing relevance and immediate application opportunity.

Create a peer mentor network leveraging early adopters as community champions. Recruit the 25.0% of users classified as Promoters (NPS greater than or equal to 9) and the 16.7% achieving excellent usability (SUS greater than or equal to 80) as peer mentors to provide ongoing support to fellow farmers within their barangays. These technologically proficient farmers, predominantly younger and more educated, can serve as first-line support for common questions and difficulties, reducing dependency on formal extension services. Provide peer mentors with incentives (e.g., free fertilizer vouchers, recognition certificates, priority access to new features) and structured training on common support issues identified through user acceptance testing. This peer network approach aligns with existing social structures and trust relationships within farming communities.
Deploy through official app stores rather than APK sideloading. Publish the application through Google Play Store to eliminate installation barriers (5.6% reported installation difficulties) and increase credibility through association with official distribution channels. While the initial pilot deployment used APK sideloading to maintain flexibility during iterative testing, production deployment should leverage established app distribution infrastructure that farmers recognize and trust. Include clear step-by-step installation instructions in Bisaya on printed materials distributed through Municipal Agriculture Office and barangay offices, with screenshots showing each tap interaction required to download and install from Play Store.

Provide sustained technical support through multiple accessible channels. Establish a multi-channel support system including a dedicated hotline (toll-free number or subsidized SMS), Facebook Messenger channel (leveraging the platform farmers already use for social communication), and email support for literate users. Ensure support is available in Bisaya and staffed by personnel familiar with Hagonoy farming practices who can provide both technical troubleshooting and agricultural context. Document common support inquiries to inform iterative application improvements and training curriculum refinements. Research on agricultural technology adoption demonstrates that availability of responsive technical support is a stronger predictor of sustained usage than initial usability alone, particularly for populations with limited prior technology experience.

Implement phased rollout starting with high-capability users to build demonstration effects. Rather than attempting simultaneous deployment across all capability segments, begin with college-educated farmers who demonstrated excellent usability (mean SUS=77.1) and rapid task completion (mean 25.7 minutes). Allow this segment to use the application for a complete cropping season, documenting their experiences and productivity outcomes. Leverage these early adopters as demonstration cases in subsequent training programs for lower-capability segments, providing concrete local evidence of value rather than abstract claims. This phased approach also allows time to implement Bisaya localization and other usability enhancements before expanding to the majority farmer population with elementary and high school education.

Research Agenda for Agricultural Technology Adoption
Conduct longitudinal field trials measuring actual productivity impacts over multiple seasons. The current research validated that farmers perceive the yield predictions as accurate and useful (PU4=4.17) and that the model achieves reasonable performance on historical data (R²=0.765), but it did not empirically measure whether using the application leads to improved fertilizer management decisions and higher actual yields. Future research should implement controlled or quasi-experimental designs comparing productivity outcomes between farmers using the application for input planning versus farmers using traditional experience-based approaches, measured over at least 2-3 cropping seasons to account for weather variability. Such research should measure both yield outcomes and economic returns, accounting for potential input cost changes if recommendations lead to altered fertilizer quantities.

Investigate optimal user interface adaptations for users spanning wide digital literacy ranges. The finding that educational attainment explained more variance in usability than any other demographic variable, with a nearly 2-fold difference in SUS scores between elementary and college graduates, suggests that capability-based interface adaptations may be necessary. Future research should experimentally compare single-interface approaches (current GabayPalay design) against dual-mode designs (simplified mode with minimal text and maximum visual guidance versus standard mode with full feature access) or progressive disclosure designs (basic workflow by default with optional advanced features). Such research should systematically vary interface elements (text versus icons, dropdown versus buttons, technical versus plain language labels) to identify which specific design patterns most strongly influence usability for low-literacy users.

Expand the predictive model to incorporate additional agronomic and environmental variables. The current model's R² of 0.765 leaves 23.5% of yield variance unexplained, suggesting opportunities for prediction improvement through additional variables. Future research should investigate incorporation of soil test results (organic matter, pH, nutrient availability), more granular weather data (rainfall timing and quantity, temperature extremes during critical growth stages), variety-specific characteristics beyond the hybrid-inbred binary (maturity duration, nutrient responsiveness, pest resistance), and management timing variables (specific days after transplanting for each fertilizer application, pest intervention timing). However, such expansions must carefully balance prediction accuracy gains against increased data collection burden for farmers, potentially rendering the application impractical if input requirements become excessive.

Develop and validate capability-based training curricula for agricultural technology adoption. The finding that prior agricultural app experience reduced task completion time by 37% (33.0 minutes versus 52.5 minutes for first-time users) suggests that general digital literacy training provides spillover benefits beyond app-specific instruction. Future research should develop structured curricula teaching foundational smartphone skills (app installation, navigation, form completion, information retrieval) in agricultural contexts, then measure whether such training improves subsequent agricultural app adoption rates and usability compared to app-specific training alone. Research should also investigate optimal training modalities (individual versus group, single-session versus distributed, hands-on practice versus demonstration) for different capability segments.

Investigate economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness of agricultural AI deployment at scale. The current research demonstrated technical feasibility of offline machine learning deployment and established that farmers perceive value in yield predictions. However, questions remain about economic sustainability: What organizational models (government extension service, private agribusiness, farmer cooperatives, NGOs) can feasibly support the training programs, peer mentor networks, and technical support infrastructure required for successful deployment? What cost structures (free to farmers with government subsidy, freemium with premium features, subscription model, one-time purchase) align with farmer willingness to pay while ensuring financial viability? How do costs per farmer decrease with scale, and what minimum user base is required for economic viability? Future research employing techno-economic analysis methods should address these questions to inform realistic deployment planning.

Policy Implications for Agricultural Technology Development
Establish usability standards specific to low-literacy agricultural populations in technology development guidelines. Current Philippine agricultural technology development policies emphasize functional requirements (what tools should do) but provide limited guidance on usability requirements (how easily target users can actually use them). Government agencies funding agricultural technology development, including the Department of Agriculture and the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD), should mandate user acceptance testing with representative low-literacy farmers and establish minimum System Usability Scale thresholds (suggesting SUS greater than or equal to 60 for low-literacy populations rather than the standard SUS greater than or equal to 70 for general populations) before approving tools for wide deployment. Such standards would prevent the pattern observed in multiple agricultural apps where technically sound functionality fails to achieve adoption due to inadequate attention to usability for the target population.

Prioritize investment in agricultural extension worker training on digital tool facilitation. The finding that 22.2% of farmers needed help from others during supervised testing, and that educational attainment strongly predicted usability (elementary: 38.5 versus college: 77.1), indicates that achieving widespread agricultural technology adoption requires human intermediation, not just better tool design. Government should invest in training programs for Municipal and Provincial Agriculture Office extension workers on facilitating farmer use of digital tools, moving beyond the current model where extension workers provide agronomic advice to a new model where they also provide technology adoption support. This training should emphasize one-on-one and small-group instruction techniques appropriate for low-literacy populations, troubleshooting common technical issues, and building peer mentor networks.

Require local language support in all government-funded agricultural technology projects. The English-only implementation of GabayPalay, while necessitated by development timeline constraints in academic research, represents a pattern in Philippine agricultural technology where tools are developed primarily in English despite target populations using regional languages (Bisaya, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, etc.) for daily agricultural communication. Government funding guidelines should mandate local language support in all agricultural technology projects, recognizing that language accessibility is not an optional enhancement but a fundamental requirement for reaching farmers with limited formal education. This mandate should include budget allocations specifically for professional translation services and usability testing with local-language interfaces.

Establish community-based agricultural technology support infrastructure integrated with existing extension services. The current Philippine agricultural extension system focuses on agronomic advice delivered through periodic farm visits, demonstrations, and Farmer Field Schools. This infrastructure should be expanded to include technology adoption support, with designated technology facilitators in each municipality trained to conduct app installation sessions, provide ongoing troubleshooting support, and organize peer learning groups. Rather than treating agricultural technology as separate from traditional extension, integrate digital tools into the extension service portfolio with recognition that achieving adoption requires sustained human support, particularly for low-literacy populations. This integrated approach aligns with the finding that farmers trust and rely on personal relationships with extension workers more than impersonal digital interfaces.

The development and evaluation of the GabayPalay application demonstrated that creating functional, scientifically valid agricultural decision support tools is technically feasible using current machine learning and mobile technologies, even for offline deployment in resource-constrained contexts. However, the research also revealed that technical functionality alone is insufficient for adoption among smallholder farmers with limited digital literacy. The substantial gap between high perceived usefulness and low perceived ease of use, the below-threshold usability scores despite simplified interface design, and the negative Net Promoter Score despite farmer recognition of value collectively demonstrate that usability barriers, rather than lack of relevant functionality, represent the primary obstacle to agricultural technology adoption in this context.

The honest acknowledgment of these challenges, supported by comprehensive empirical documentation through systematic user acceptance testing, provides more valuable guidance for future agricultural technology development than selective reporting of only positive outcomes would have offered. The specific usability barriers identified—NPK display confusion, fertilizer selection difficulty, unit conversion challenges, help dependency—provide actionable targets for iterative improvement. The validated constraints—digital literacy gaps, confusion with technical terminology, variable measurement practices—establish realistic expectations for achievable usability and appropriate deployment strategies emphasizing training and peer support rather than expecting independent adoption.

Ultimately, this research contributes to the growing understanding that successful agricultural technology adoption in Philippine smallholder contexts requires not just better tools but comprehensive sociotechnical systems integrating well-designed applications with training programs, peer support networks, local language localization, and sustained technical assistance infrastructure. The path forward requires sustained attention to the human dimensions of technology adoption, recognizing that farmers' sophisticated agricultural knowledge and experience-based decision-making capabilities must be respected and accommodated rather than displaced by digital tools positioning themselves as superior alternatives to farmer expertise.
