SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
This study developed and evaluated GabayPalay, an offline Android application that predicts potential palay yield from agronomic factors under farmers’ control in Hagonoy, Davao del Sur. The work combined empirical investigation of local farming practices and technology use, Random Forest model development and mobile deployment, and user acceptance testing with rice farmers who had little or no prior experience with agricultural applications.
The investigation confirmed that production decisions among participating farmers were shaped primarily by experience, seasonal rhythms, and occasional technician advice. All farmers interviewed reported that they had never used an agricultural mobile application (I12), and none described systematic use of digital tools for planning, monitoring, or evaluating their crops. At the same time, interviews and surveys documented consistent seasonal management patterns, including transplanting-based establishment, three-stage fertilization, and mostly preventive pest management focused on a small set of salient pests such as stem borer and golden apple snail (I2 to I4, I10 to I11). Within these patterns, several management levels for improved productivity became evident, particularly optimized seed rates, more precise timing and splitting of fertilizer applications, and targeted pest control at establishment and early growth stages. These findings guided the formulation of functional requirements FR1 to FR6 and non-functional requirements NFR1 to NFR5, and yielded a 27-feature input set centered on variables that farmers can directly observe and influence, such as seed variety, seed quantity, timing and amount of split fertilizer applications, pest incidence and protection measures, irrigation practice, and a binary indicator of weather-related challenges.
Within this data and requirements context, a Random Forest regressor was trained to predict yield from the 27-feature set. The model achieved R² of 0.765 on a held-out test set, explaining about three quarters of the variance in reported yields and outperforming a Linear Regression baseline. Hyperparameter selection identified a configuration that maintained accuracy while remaining feasible for on-device deployment, and automated conversion through m2cgen produced Java model code that matched the original Python implementation exactly. This enabled offline prediction on resource-constrained Android devices in line with NFR1 and NFR4. 
GabayPalay operationalized the functional and non-functional requirements in a three-layer architecture with a clear separation between user interface, business logic, and data storage. The application implemented offline yield prediction using the embedded Random Forest model (FR1), stage-based nutrient management screens that accept familiar commercial fertilizer products and internally compute NPK nutrients (FR2), and pest and weather input flows aligned with local practice (FR3 and FR4). It also provided an explanation layer through feature importance visualisation that highlights the relative influence of inputs such as seed rate, variety, and split fertilization on the current prediction (FR5), and a history module that stores past prediction sessions and allows longitudinal review and comparison (FR6). Together, these features allow farmers to configure several input combinations, obtain yield estimates for each, and use the history records and importance view to compare scenarios and reflect on which factors contributed most to predicted outcomes. The environmental challenge variable, which summarizes major weather risks as a binary input, supports scenario-based risk assessment by letting farmers explore both favorable and challenging seasons for a given management plan. Pre-deployment testing indicated that the 12.4 MB APK size and rapid prediction times met device compatibility and performance expectations for low to mid-range Android phones (NFR1 and NFR3), and inspection of permissions and storage confirmed that all data entry, prediction, and history functionality operated offline within the application's private storage (NFR4). Activity-based navigation, staged input, and validation feedback were designed to support NFR2 in the presence of low average formal education and variable smartphone experience.
User acceptance testing with 36 farmers showed that GabayPalay was recognized as useful but not universally easy to use. The mean System Usability Scale score was 60.3, which is below the commonly cited acceptability threshold. SUS scores varied widely across participants, from low ratings among some users to perfect scores among others. Stratified analysis revealed a clear gradient. Farmers with only elementary education reported an average SUS of 38.54, high school graduates averaged 68.68, and those with college level or graduate education averaged 77.14. A similar pattern appeared when SUS was grouped by daily smartphone usage. Participants who used smartphones less than one hour per day averaged 37.00, those using smartphones one to three hours averaged 61.79, those in the three-to-five-hour range averaged 75.36, and those using smartphones more than five hours per day averaged 81.50. In practical terms, GabayPalay approached or exceeded the SUS benchmark for farmers with at least high school education and moderate to intensive smartphone use but fell well below this threshold among farmers with limited education and minimal digital exposure. These findings are consistent with the digital literacy and adoption constraints that informed NFR2, and they indicate that the prototype currently provides acceptable usability only for a subset of the intended population.
Technology Acceptance Model results complemented the SUS outcomes. Perceived Usefulness scores were high on average, especially for items relating to improved yield prediction accuracy and time savings in planning. Farmers frequently reported that GabayPalay helped them estimate potential yields, see the implications of alternative fertilizer plans, and think more systematically about their input choices. These responses align with the intent of FR1, FR2, FR5, and FR6 to support planning, comparison, and post-harvest reflection, rather than to function solely as a calculator. Perceived Ease of Use scores were moderate, with lower averages for learnability and perceived effort. Several farmers with limited smartphone exposure required assistance to interpret nutrient displays, switch between units, or navigate back and forth through the stages. The Net Promoter Score was negative, and qualitative explanations indicated that this reflected usability difficulties and language barriers rather than a lack of perceived value. Many participants explicitly requested a Bisaya version and simpler explanations of technical terms, which points directly back to the partially satisfied state of NFR2 and the decision to defer full vernacular localization in the prototype.
Overall, the work demonstrated that a machine learning model trained on farmer-reported management data can be used to provide useful yield predictions in a purely offline, mobile environment, and that such a model can be integrated into an application whose workflow and features are grounded in local practices and constraints identified during requirements elicitation (I1 to I12, FR1 to FR6, NFR1 to NFR5). GabayPalay implemented the specified functional requirements and delivered recognized value in terms of planning and decision support, especially for farmers with higher education and more intensive smartphone use. At the same time, the study showed that predictive accuracy and offline capability are not, by themselves, sufficient to guarantee inclusive use in a population with heterogeneous literacy and digital experience. The moderate overall usability, strong stratification of SUS scores by education and smartphone usage, and repeated calls for Bisaya localization all indicate that NFR2 is only partially met and that further design work is needed to make the system broadly usable without external assistance.
Future work on the modelling side should prioritize larger and more diverse datasets and the inclusion of selected environmental variables. Increasing the number of farms and seasons represented in the training data, while maintaining diversity in farm sizes and management styles, would support more robust modelling, especially at the extremes of yield where current prediction errors were higher. Extending the feature set to incorporate accessible environmental signals, such as rainfall and temperature summaries for each cropping period, would address part of the unexplained variance that arises from climate and weather conditions. These additions will need to respect the offline-first constraint by using data sources and update mechanisms that remain compatible with intermittent connectivity, for example periodic synchronization when devices can access a network.
On the application side, a clear priority for the next iteration is language localization. Translating interface text, input labels, guidance messages, and explanation content into Bisaya, and expressing agronomic concepts in locally familiar terms, directly responds to user feedback and to the observed dependence of usability on education level. Localization should avoid literal word-for-word translation and instead focus on phrases and examples that match how farmers already talk about fertilizer products, units, timing, and weather-related problems. Alongside localization, richer contextual help should be introduced throughout the workflow. This could include short, on-screen explanations that can be expanded on demand, visual cues for typical value ranges, and, where feasible, simple illustrations or short clips that demonstrate how to interpret NPK displays, choose units, or understand feature importance. Contextual help of this kind would address the repeated need for assistance observed during user testing and would give farmers a way to revisit instructions at their own pace.
Further interface refinement should build directly on the specific confusion points documented in the user acceptance testing. Fertilizer entry screens can be simplified by pairing product names with images and by handling kilograms and sacks through automatic conversion with clear equivalence labels. NPK summaries should be accompanied by plain-language labels such as “Nitrogen for leaf and stem growth” rather than only numeric symbols, and the multi-stage workflow should provide more visible progress indicators and clearer affordances for moving between stages. In addition, future versions should allow farmers to record their actual yield for each prediction stored in the history, so that they can directly compare predicted and realized yields and so that subsequent iterations of the model can use these records for calibration and retraining. These changes are intended to reduce cognitive load and make the application more forgiving for farmers with limited formal education and low smartphone experience.
Beyond model and interface changes, future work can explore how GabayPalay is used over longer periods and in combination with existing support structures. Multi-season follow-up studies that track how often farmers use the application, how they interpret predictions relative to actual harvests, and whether they adjust fertilizer plans or pest management as a result would provide a clearer picture of impact. Comparisons between groups with and without access to localization and enhanced help features, or between farmers using different walkthrough and training strategies, could identify which design and support combinations most effectively improve independent use across literacy levels. Collaboration with cooperatives and extension workers would also be valuable to understand how the tool fits into existing advisory practices and whether peer discussions or group sessions help farmers to understand and trust its recommendations.
Through these next iterations, GabayPalay can move from a prototype that demonstrates technical feasibility and partial usability to a more mature tool that operates on richer data, accounts more explicitly for environmental variation, and presents information in language and formats that are accessible to a wider range of users. In this way, the application has the potential to evolve into a practical decision-support aid that helps smallholder farmers in Hagonoy and similar settings manage agronomic factors more systematically and respond more confidently to the uncertainties of rice production.
