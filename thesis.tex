\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This is the introduction chapter. It sets up the context for the research.

\section{Background and Motivation}

This section provides background information.

\subsection{Related work}

This subsection discusses related work in the field.

\subsubsection{Specific topic.}
This is a run-in heading that continues with the paragraph text immediately following the heading.

\section{Research Questions}

This section outlines the research questions addressed in this thesis.

\chapter{METHODOLOGY}

This chapter describes the methodology used in the research.

\section{Experimental Setup}

The experimental setup is described in this section. In this work, we utilize mathematical formulas to express key relationships. For instance, the quadratic formula is given by:
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

\section{Example with Figure}

This section demonstrates the proper way to introduce and discuss figures. The following paragraph introduces the figure.

Figure \ref{fig:example} presents an example visualization of the data collected during the experimental phase. The figure illustrates the key trends observed in the dataset.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\fbox{\parbox{0.8\textwidth}{\centering [Example Figure Placeholder]}}
\caption{Example figure showing experimental results}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

The figure reveals several important patterns in the data. First, we observe a linear relationship between the two variables. Second, the variance increases with higher values of the independent variable. These observations support the hypotheses presented in the previous chapter.

\section{Example with Table}

This section demonstrates the proper way to introduce and discuss tables. The following paragraph introduces the table.

Table \ref{tab:example} summarizes the key statistics from the experimental results. The table presents mean values and standard deviations for each experimental condition.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Summary statistics for experimental conditions}
\label{tab:example}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
Condition & Mean & Std Dev \\
\hline
Control & 10.5 & 2.3 \\
Treatment A & 15.2 & 3.1 \\
Treatment B & 18.7 & 2.8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The table shows that Treatment B achieved the highest mean value of 18.7, which represents a 78\% increase over the control condition. Treatment A also showed improvement with a mean of 15.2. The standard deviations remain relatively consistent across conditions, indicating stable measurement precision.

\chapter{RESULTS}
